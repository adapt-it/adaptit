<h2>Retrieving words and phrases from the knowledge base</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It stores adaptations for phrases as well as individual words. The stored phrases can be up to 10 source language words in length. When making an adaptation, Adapt It retrieves the word or phrase from the knowledge base.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To retrieve an adaptation, the application searches for phrases first. The application starts with 10 word phrases and then proceeds to search shorter phrases until a match is made or there is no entry for that word or phrase. Adapt It then takes action according to the following rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If a match is made and there is only one adaptation, Adapt It copies the adaptation into the target cell and moves to the next location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the knowledge base contains two or more adaptations, Adapt It displays a dialog box and allows the user to make a choice of the translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If no match is found, Adapt It copies the source word to the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> and displays it as selected. Adapt It then waits for you to edit or replace it with an adaptation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="BodyText">To make this feature as useful as possible for retrieving phrases, you need to carefully <a href="../../User_Interface/Phrase_Box/Make_a_phrase.htm">make the phrase</a> in the first place. You should attempt to make phrases that are likely to be used in other places. In addition, keep your phrases short; phrases of five or less words are likely to be the most useful.</p>
