<h2>The Adapt It user interface</h2>
<p class="BodyText">A <span class="DefinedWord">user interface</span> is what you as the user of an <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> sees as you work with the computer to do your task. Adapt It has its own unique interface, because it is a unique application. If you are familiar with other MS Windows applications you will recognize similarities to those programs. However, Adapt It has many features that are not included in other applications. Most of these differences result from the fact that Adapt It is a language <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> application.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It <span class="DefinedWord">user interface</span> follows many of the standards for Windows application. However, the unique features of Adapt It require that the user interface contain special structures, icons and tools. There are two main divisions of the interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Adapt_It_user_interface_control_bars.htm">Adapt It user interface control bars</a></p>
<p class="BodyText">At the top of the interface are four bars used to control and manage Adapt It's features. Three bars are normally visible, with the fourth bar invisible until requested by the user. The control and management bars contain menus and Adapt It icons used to perform application functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/AI_Main_Window/Main_window.htm">Main window</a></p>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It main window is below the control bars. The main window resembles a cross between a word processing application and a spreadsheet application. The purpose is to enter and manage text; however, the text is arranged into rows and columns called <span class="DefinedWord">strips</span> and <span class="DefinedWord">piles</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
