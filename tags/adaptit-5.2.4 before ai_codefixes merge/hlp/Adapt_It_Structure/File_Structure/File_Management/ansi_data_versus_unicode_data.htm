<h2>ANSI data versus Unicode data</h2>
<p class="BodyText">There are a number of <span class="DefinedWord">data formats</span> used by computers. The American National Standards Institute (<span class="DefinedWord">ANSI</span>) has defined a format for characters using one <span class="DefinedWord">byte</span> of data for each character. This format is useful for European or Latin-based languages and for many near-Eastern languages. This format is generally called ANSI.</p>
<p class="BodyText">A more extensive data format using two or more bytes of data for each character is called <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span>. Using Unicode allows the representation of all written languages in the world.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The two versions of Adapt It differ in the internal representation of data. Adapt It Regular uses data storage which conforms to the ANSI standard. This standard supports Latin-based alphabets with some flexibility for specially designed characters. Adapt It Unicode uses the Unicode standard internally, thus permitting it to support Eastern and mid-Eastern languages.</p>
