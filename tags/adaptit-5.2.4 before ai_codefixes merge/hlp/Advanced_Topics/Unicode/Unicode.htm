<h2>Unicode</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Unicode is a character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all written languages in the world. The Unicode character repertoire has multiple representation forms, including <span class="DefinedWord">UTF-8</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">UTF-16</span>, and UTF-32. Most Windows interfaces use the UTF-16 form. The Adapt It Unicode version uses UTF-16 also known as UCS-2.</p>
<p class="BodyText">For most purposes, you do not need to be concerned about how Adapt It stores its data.</p>
<h4><img src="../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>

<p class="BodyText">Adapt It comes in two forms: Adapt It Regular and Adapt It Unicode. Adapt It Regular does not use Unicode. See <a href="../../Getting_Started/Adapt_It_Regular_versus_Adapt_It_Unicode.htm">Adapt It Regular versus Adapt It Unicode</a> for more information.</p>
