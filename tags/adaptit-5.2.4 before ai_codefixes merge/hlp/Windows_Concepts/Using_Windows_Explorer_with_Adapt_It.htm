<h2>Using Windows Explorer with Adapt It</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Windows Explorer is the user interface tool provided with the Windows operating system. It allows you to work with the computer in running various applications. One capability of Explorer that applies to Adapt It is the ability to manage files. Explorer allows you to manage document files outside of the Adapt It application. Using Explorer you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Copy document files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Move document files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Rename document files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Delete unwanted document files</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Copy document files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Copying a file means to create a new file with the same contents as the original. Generally you will copy a file to a different location on the hard drive. Copying a file does not remove it from the original location. Both copies of the file have the same filename and filename extension. You should note that after a file is copied, any changes made to one of copies, are <span class="Strong">not</span> applied in the other copy.</p>
<h3>Move document files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Moving a file means that you remove a file from a location and place it in a new location. As a result there is still only one copy of the file.</p>
<h3>Rename document files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">You can use Explorer to give a new name to a document file. For example, if you wish to set up a temporary document to try out alternative translations, you can make a copy of the original document and give it a new name. Use Adapt It to open the copied and renamed document. Make any changes in this new document. If you decide to keep the new changes, you can delete the original document and rename the test document to the original name. If you decide not to accept the changes, simply delete the test document.</p>
<h3>Delete document files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">As you work on a project you may find that you have created files that are no longer useful and keeping them just clutters and confuses the project. The Explorer Delete function allows you to remove these files from the project. Be careful when deleting files from a project in that you may not be able to recover them once they have been deleted.</p>
<h4><img src="../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Do not use Explorer to manage files while Adapt It is running. If you should change a file being used by the active project, the effects are not predictable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
