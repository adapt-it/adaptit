<h2>A<a name="A" id="A"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Active location -</span> the current location of the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. In Adapt It, each <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> has many storage locations or <span class="DefinedWord">piles</span>. These storage locations hold the adaptations in the <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span>. Only the storage location under the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> is available for work. Moving the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> also moves the active location.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Adapt It</span> - a computer <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> that assists language translators in the conversion of text from one language to another. Since Adapt It is designed for use with <span class="Emphasis">languages that are closely related</span>, the term <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> rather than <span class="DefinedWord">translation is used</span> to describe the process.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Adapt It document format (ADT)</span> - the file format used in Adapt It versions 2.4.1i and earlier. All of these Adapt It documents are stored with the <span class="DefinedWord">filename extension</span> "adt." Version 3.0 and greater use the <span class="DefinedWord">XML</span> format but can read and use adt as well.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Adaptation -</span> a form of translation that takes advantage of similarities in related languages to speed the translation process. When used as a noun, an adaptation refers to a document that has been adapted from another language.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">ANSI</span> - an acronym for American National Standards Institute. This organization defines standards for computing languages. In particular, it extended the 128 characters of the <span class="DefinedWord">ASCII</span> <span class="DefinedWord">character set</span> to 256. The ANSI character sets can support a wider variety of human languages than does the ASCII character set--in particular, European and near-Eastern languages. ANSI character sets use all eight <span class="DefinedWord">bits</span> of a single <span class="DefinedWord">byte</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Application</span> - a computer program designed to help people to efficiently deal with some human problem involving <span class="DefinedWord">information</span>. In these Helps, the term refers either to Adapt It (Regular) or Adapt It Unicode.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">ASCII</span> - an acronym for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This computer code contains 128 unique values, each representing a number, letter, or formatting symbol of a human language. The ASCII character set supports English explicitly.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Automatic mode</span> - a mode where Adapt It moves the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase</span> box through the document, stopping only when the application cannot find an adaptation in the knowledge base, or when <span class="Emphasis">more than one</span> adaptation is possible.</p>
<h2>B<a name="B" id="B"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Back translation -</span> is a method for validating the quality of a translation. A person or persons who knows both the target language and a language known by a translation consultant, retranslates the target translation somewhat literally into the consultant&#39;s language.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Backup</span> - a process to make copies of <span class="DefinedWord">documents</span> and other files. These files "backup" the original and can replace the original should it be damaged or lost.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Binary data</span> - data in the form of a series of ones and zeroes. Computers use binary data internally. Binary data is mostly unintelligible when a human being tries to read it directly.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Bit</span> - an electronic element that a computer uses to represent a one or zero.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Book folder mode</span> - a mode Adapt It uses to store documents into a subfolder of the <span class="UserInterface">Adaptations</span> folder. Each subfolder is named after a book of the Bible for easy reference. Book folder mode is optional.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Bundle</span> - the collection of source text words available in the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span> at any one time (generally 300 words). As necessary, Adapt It replaces the current bundle with another bundle.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Byte</span> - a collection of eight <span class="Emphasis">bits</span> used by a computer to represent a character such as a letter or number.</p>
<h2>C<a name="C" id="C"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Cell</span> - the smallest storage element in the layout of an Adapt It document. A cell contains a word, phrase, or <span class="DefinedWord">empty cell marker</span>. Like a spreadsheet cell, the Adapt It cell has both a horizontal and vertical dimension. Thus, a cell is a member of both a <span class="Emphasis">strip</span> and a <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Character set</span> - an organization of <span class="DefinedWord">binary</span> data used by a computer to represent the letters and numbers of a human language. Each letter or number is a character and is represented by a specific combination of <span class="DefinedWord">bits</span>. Character sets are based on a standard number of bits, generally 7, 8, or 16. A larger number of bits makes it possible to represent a larger number of unique characters can be used in the character set. Common character sets include <span class="DefinedWord">ASCII</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">ANSI</span>, and <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Clipboard</span> - a special area in the memory of the computer used to store data temporarily. Once data is placed in the clipboard, the data then can be retrieved for use in other places. The clipboard works with the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu functions: <span class="DefinedWord">cut</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">copy</span>, and <span class="DefinedWord">paste</span>. In the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>, these functions work only within the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Configuration file</span> - one of several files Adapt It uses to store the settings that control the user interface and other operations.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Consistent change rule</span> - an instruction to Adapt It to make a predefined change while adapting source text.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Consistent change table</span> - a collection of <span class="DefinedWord">consistent change rules</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Consistent Changes</span> - an application that uses rules to automatically make regular changes, such as changes to word prefixes and endings.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Copy</span> - a process to duplicate data for storage in another location. Within a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span>, copied data is placed into the <span class="DefinedWord">clipboard</span>. In addition, entire documents or files may be copied to other folders or storage devices.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Copy text</span> - a standard MS Windows function that copies selected text from a document or file into the clipboard. The copy command can be found as an icon<img src="Images/COPY_ICON.GIF"> on the <span class="UserInterface">Tool</span> bar, or as an option in the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Corrupt file</span> - a file that has been changed in some way so that it is no longer usable by a program. Files can be corrupted through human error, program error, or when the computer fails in the middle of work.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Cut</span> - a standard MS Windows function that removes selected text from a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">file</span> and places it into the <span class="DefinedWord">clipboard</span>. The cut command can be found as an icon<img src="Images/CUT_ICON.GIF"> on the <span class="UserInterface">Tool</span> bar, or as an option in the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu.</p>
<h2>D<a name="D" id="D"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Dialog box</span> - a window that an <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> opens temporarily in order to either show information you need to know, or to request from you the data the software needs to continue working. This window is often called a dialog because it is a way for you and the computer to "talk."</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Dialog box tab</span> - a page marker in a dialog box. These tabs are used when a dialog box must deal with more topics than can be shown on one screen. By clicking on the tab, you see its related page.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="Images/Preferences_dialog_unicode_tab.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Docked toolbar</span> - A docked toolbar is attached to one edge of the program window.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Document</span> - the primary unit of work in Adapt It. The document may represent a book or a chapter. All work is done within a document. Documents are part of a project. In Adapt It, a document is a computer file that contains at a minimum contains <span class="DefinedWord">source language text</span>. As adaptation occurs the document contains <span class="DefinedWord">target language text</span>. The document may also contain <span class="DefinedWord">gloss text</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">free translations</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">back translations</span>, and <span class="DefinedWord">notes</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Drafting mode</span> - the default mode for creating adaptations in Adapt It. In drafting mode, the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> moves automatically through the document inserting previously defined adaptations and skipping locations that already contain adaptations. Drafting mode can be used with <span class="DefinedWord">Automatic</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">Single Step modes</span>.</p>
<h2>E<a name="E" id="E"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Edit text -</span> the process of changing words and phrases in a document. Editing includes changing words, spellings and the arrangement of words or phrases. Adapt It generally uses the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span> and <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> for editing.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Empty cell marker</span> - an ellipsis (…) inserted into the source text instead of words. This marker appears when the target language <span class="DefinedWord">syntax</span> requires a word but the source language does not. The empty cell marker allows Adapt It to maintain a <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span> even when there is no source text.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Empty location</span> - an area in Adapt It's <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span> in which no <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span> is visible. An empty location can occur when no <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> has been made resulting in a <span class="DefinedWord">hole.</span></p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Encoded text file</span> - a text file using an <span class="DefinedWord">encoding standard</span>. Encoding standards exist to represent the character sets or <span class="DefinedWord">fonts</span> used in different languages. Adapt It uses one of two encoding standards: <span class="DefinedWord">ANSI</span> (which includes <span class="DefinedWord">ASCII</span>) and <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span>. Adapt It (Regular) uses ANSI to represent <span class="DefinedWord">legacy</span> fonts and computer operating systems. Adapt It Unicode provides the ability to represent both Western and non-western fonts using the Unicode encoding standard.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Encoding standard -</span> a set of rules that guide computer software in the interpretation of numeric values as characters in an <span class="DefinedWord">encoded text file</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Exegesis -</span> a process by which the meaning of a document is recovered from the original language.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Export</span> - the process of copying a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">file</span> used by one <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> into a <span class="DefinedWord">format</span> usable by some other application. For example, Adapt It can export a document into a format that Microsoft Word can read.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</span> - the file format used in Adapt It versions 3.0 and greater to store <span class="DefinedWord">documents</span> and <span class="DefinedWord">Knowledge bases</span>. XML gives Adapt It more flexibility to organize and work with documents and knowledge bases. Previously these files were stored in <span class="DefinedWord">binary</span> format.</p>
<h2>F<a name="F" id="F"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">File</span> - a collection of data that a computer can read or write. The data in the file must be in a <span class="DefinedWord">format</span> that the computer can recognize. <span class="DefinedWord">Applications</span> use files to store data for use.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Filename -</span> the label used by a computer to identify files. The filename has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Filename title – this gives a unique name to the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">A dot (.) – this separates the filename title from the <span class="DefinedWord">filename extension</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="DefinedWord">Filename extension</span> - tells the computer what kind of data is contained in the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Filename extension</span> - the portion of a computer <span class="DefinedWord">filename</span> that tells the computer what type of <span class="DefinedWord">data</span> is in the file. The filename extension is usually three characters long and follows a dot "." in the filename.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Filter -</span> an Adapt It technique for the hiding of certain types of information so that it is not normally visible in the <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> process. Filtering provides a way to hide, without removing, information in the document that does not have to be adapted. Such information is necessary for some other purpose such as publication.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Footer</span> - a line of text that appears at the bottom of a page. Adapt It builds a footer line when it prints or shows a print preview of a document.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Format</span> - a standard way of arranging information. Many computer <span class="DefinedWord">applications</span> require that their <span class="DefinedWord">files</span> have a particular format. The file formats generally have a unique <span class="DefinedWord">filename extension</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Free translation</span> - one method used to validate the quality of a translation. A free translation is restatement of the adaptation in that it is generally less literal than a back translation, and does not necessarily follow the grammatical patterns of the original translation. A free translation can supplement a back translation, because it provides a natural reading of the text. Adapt It has a special mode that allows free translations to be prepared and displayed in their own line along with the source text and target texts in the Main window.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Floating toolbar</span> - A floating toolbar is not attached to the edge of the program window. You can change the shape of some floating toolbars.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Font</span> - a set of formats that can be applied to a <span class="DefinedWord">character set</span>. A font defines how characters look on the computer screen or printed page. The font defines the shape, size, and color of each character.</p>
<h2>G<a name="G" id="G"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Gloss text</span> - text of a gloss that can appear in Adapt It. It is used to represent the literal meaning of the source text words and phrases, in a language somewhat different from the <span class="DefinedWord">source</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span>. Gloss text has its own line in each strip in the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Glossing</span> - a translation technique showing the literal meaning of words, sometimes in a third language to assist the process. Glossing provides an alternate version of the text's original version.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Grayed out</span> - a term to describe the status of menu items or <span class="DefinedWord">icons</span>. Items that appear to be grayer than other items cannot be used at this time. Grayed out items cannot be used because they do not make sense at this point, or they might cause the <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> to give undesirable results.</p>
<p class="SpaceSingle">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>H<a name="H" id="H"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Hacked legacy font</span> - a term for a font that has been changed to represent the sounds of a previously unwritten language. As a result, the shapes of the letters in the font are unique to this language. Hacking is the process of changing the shapes. Legacy means that the change was done before there was any other way to produce the shape. The <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span> <span class="DefinedWord">encoding standard</span> system has eliminated the need to create hacked legacy fonts in the future.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Hole</span> - a <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span> location that does not contain an adaptation. A hole is a place where Adapt It can insert an <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span>.</p>
<h2>I<a name="I" id="I"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Import</span> - the process of converting a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">file</span> created in one <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> into a <span class="DefinedWord">format</span> usable by the current application.</p>
<a name="J" id="J"></a>
<h2>K<a name="K" id="K"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Knowledge base</span> - the set of <span class="DefinedWord">files</span> used by Adapt It to store, organize, and to retrieve <span class="DefinedWord">adaptations</span>. Adapt It uses two types of knowledge bases: adaptation and glossing.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Knowledge base lookup</span> - the process of searching the <span class="Emphasis">Knowledge Base</span> to find if a <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> word or phrase is stored there, and if it is, to return its one or more adaptations.</p>
<h2>L<a name="L" id="L"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Legacy</span> - a term referring to an older way of doing things. For example, versions of Adapt It prior to version 3.0 can be called legacy applications.</p>
<p class="SpaceSingle">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>M<a name="M" id="M"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Main window</span> - the <span class="DefinedWord">user interface</span> where most of the <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> work takes place. It includes <span class="DefinedWord">piles</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">strips</span>, and the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="Images/Main_window.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Menu</span> - A menu is a list of commands that is displayed when you click a menu name on a menu bar or other toolbar.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Menu bar</span> - The menu bar is the horizontal bar below the title bar that contains the names of menus.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Merge</span> - the process of combining two or more source texts words into a phrase. You can then adapt the phrase as a whole instead of just single words.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Mode</span> - a restriction on the features or set of features that Adapt It can use at any one time. The modes are intended to promote efficient use of Adapt It for specific tasks. These operational modes are controlled by the <span class="UserInterface">Mode</span> bar.</p>
<h2>N<a name="N" id="N"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Navigation -</span> the process of moving around in a document<span class="Strong">.</span></p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Navigation text</span> - the text in the Main window that identifies the chapter and verse of the <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span>.</p>
<h2>O<a name="O" id="O"></a></h2>
<p class="SpaceSingle">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>P<a name="P" id="P"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Parsing</span> - the process by which Adapt It takes a file of text data and scans through it to form the document in the Main window. This process isolates each word in the source text, and stores it in a document storage element.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Paste</span> - a standard MS Windows function that places text stored in the clipboard into a document.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Phrase</span> - a group of words that makes sense as a unit. Sometimes, adaptation is better done using a phrase rather than word by word. Adapt It allows adaptations of phrases as well as words.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Phrase box</span> - the primary point of contact between you and Adapt It. You can use the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> to enter new <span class="DefinedWord">adaptations</span>, revise current adaptations, or replace old adaptations.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="Images/Phrase_box.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Pile</span> - a stack of words or phrases, arranged vertically in the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>. The words or phrases in each pile all line up on the left. (In languages that read from right to left, they would line up on the right.) Each <span class="DefinedWord">strip</span> in the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span> consists of multiple piles. See <span class="DefinedWord">Main window</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Placeholder</span> - an indicator (…) in the <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> showing that there is no corresponding word or phrase for a word or phrase in the <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span>. A placeholder is used to maintain a source entry in the pile when the target language requires a word or phrase but the source language does not.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Plain text file</span> - a computer file containing text, punctuation, and on occasion standard format markings (SFM) as well. Plain text files contain only letters and symbols that <span class="Emphasis">can be typed from the keyboard</span>. Adapt It uses plain text files to create the source text portion of <span class="DefinedWord">documents</span>. Adapt It can also export plain text files for use by other <span class="DefinedWord">applications</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Preferences</span> - Adapt It settings that allow you to control how you work with the <span class="DefinedWord">application</span>. You can change how the <span class="DefinedWord">source</span> and <span class="DefinedWord">target texts</span> appear along with many other features. Use the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu to open the <span class="UserInterface">Preferences</span> <span class="DefinedWord">dialog box</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Propagation</span> - a technique used in Adapt It, by which filtered material such as back translations, free translations, and Adapt It notes can be passed on to other translation projects.</p>
<h2>Q<a name="Q" id="Q"></a></h2>
<p class="SpaceSingle">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>R<a name="R" id="R"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Restore</span> - the process of recreating a document or knowledge base by using a backup file or other files.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Retranslation</span> - when you enter your own translation of a passage rather than accepting the <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> produced by Adapt It. Generally, retranslation is done when the syntax or <span class="DefinedWord">exegesis</span> of the adaptation is incorrect or misleading.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Reviewing mode</span> - a mode where Adapt It moves the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> one location at time and displays the current adaptation. Reviewing mode provides a method to examine each adaptation in a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span>. Reviewing mode is the opposite of <span class="DefinedWord">Drafting mode</span> and does not allow the use of <span class="DefinedWord">Automatic mode</span> nor <span class="DefinedWord">Single Step mode</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Rich text format (RTF)</span> - a <span class="DefinedWord">file format</span> used by many word processing programs. Adapt It can <span class="DefinedWord">export</span> files in RTF so that they can be edited in MS Word in connection with the <span class="DefinedWord">Word Scripture Template</span> for publishing purposes.</p>
<h2>S<a name="S" id="S"></a></h2>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Save</span> - a process used to place a copy of a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> currently in the computers memory onto the computer's disk. Saving a document assures that it will be available the next time you run the <span class="DefinedWord">application</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">SFM</span> - see Standard Format Markers.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Shortcut key</span> - a key or combination of keys that can be used instead of a menu or toolbar item. For example, you can use <span class="TypedText">Ctrl+X</span> instead of the <span class="UserInterface">Cut</span> option in the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu or the cut icon <img src="Images/CUT_ICON.GIF"> on the <span class="UserInterface">Tools</span> bar.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Single Step mode</span> - Single Step mode moves the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase</span> <span class="UserInterface">box</span> to the next empty location, looks up the source text in the knowledge base, and inserts an adaptation into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> and then waits for an action from the user.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Source text</span> - the original document or file in a particular language (the <span class="DefinedWord">source language</span>) that is to be translated or adapted into another language (the <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span>). Adapt It shows the source text as the first line of text (other than navigation text) in the <span class="DefinedWord">strips</span> of the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>. When first input into Adapt It for adaptation, the source text must be in a <span class="DefinedWord">plain text file</span>. To be most useful, a source text should also be input as a <span class="DefinedWord">standard format text file</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Source language</span> - the language from which a translation is made. The <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> is a text written in the source language.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Splitting a document</span> - the process by which a document can be broken into two or more smaller documents.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Standard format markers (SFM)</span> - combinations of characters embedded into the text to indicate book, chapter, verse, etc. Standard format markers contain a backward slash (\) as the first character. Adapt It uses these markers internally and adds the necessary markers when exporting text files.
