<h2>Use Transliteration Mode</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Use Transliteration Mode</span> entry is a <span class="DefinedWord">toggle</span> that turns Transliteration Mode on and off. This option is only available when SIL converters are installed with Adapt It Unicode. Although Adapt It (Regular) can support Transliteration, its type of project is not generally complex enough to justify its use.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Transliteration mode requires an extended discussion, thus we do not cover Transliteration and SIL in detail in these helps. However, the Adapt It installation files contain a document discussing these topics.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The use of Transliteration mode should be limited to projects specifically set up to use this application. Operating in Transliteration mode requires a special use of the Adapt It knowledge base. Adapt It allows the SIL converters to make the adaptation rather than the knowledge base. Therefore, as Adapt It find a hole it calls the SIL converter to make an adaptation and place it into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. You need to determine if the adaptation is acceptable or not and do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the adaptation is acceptable, press either <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl+Enter</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Alt+BackSpace</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It places a &lt;Not in KB&gt; entry into the knowledge base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the adaptation is not acceptable, edit the entry in the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> or enter a new adaptation. Then press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It places the correct text into the knowledge base.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It encounters the word or phrase the next time, it checks the knowledge base. If it finds a &lt;Not in KV&gt; marker, Adapt It calls the SIL converter to make the adaptation and then continues on to the next location. If the knowledge base does not have a &lt;Not in KB&gt; marker, Adapt It uses the adaptation in the knowledge base and then continues on to the next location.</p>
