<h2>Source text preparation</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The preparation of <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> must be done outside of Adapt It. This can be done in other translation tools such as Paratext, Shoebox, and Toolbox. In addition, adaptations prepared in Adapt It can serve as source text for some other adaptation project.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It assumes the presence of <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Standard_Format_Markings/Standard_Format_Markers.htm">SFM markers</a> in the source text and uses them for organization and navigational purposes. Each of the above tools uses SFM and can provide them in the files to be used by Adapt It.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The source text should be as "clean" as possible. While it is possible to <a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/Edit_Menu/Edit_Source_text.htm">edit the source text</a> and make minor corrections, it is best to have the source correct before using Adapt It.</p>
<p class="BodyText">It is possible to create source text files manually by using a text processor. This process is difficult, open to error, and requires a good knowledge of SFM</p>
