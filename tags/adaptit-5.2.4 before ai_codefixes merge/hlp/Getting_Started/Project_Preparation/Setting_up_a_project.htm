<h2>Setting up a project</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Before starting a major project there are several issues that need to be addressed. Some of these deal with the nature of the languages that you are to use. Others involve the working interface you want to use.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The following topics are considerations you should make in setting up a project:</p>
<h3><a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Managing_Fonts.htm">Fonts</a></h3>
<p class="BodyText">It is important that you have established the fonts and character sets for Adapt It to use. Fonts are particularly important in non-Latin alphabets. If your project's language, either source or target, has special character shapes not found in common world language, you should consider using Adapt It Unicode. The use of Unicode allows virtually any character to be represented. The Unicode version also can work with languages that read from right to left.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If your project's language source or target language is encoded in a legacy encoding, you may want to use Adapt It Regular. Fonts for representing legacy encodings may sometimes be hacked fonts, meaning that the visible representation of one or more characters in the font set has been altered. This is done to provide for special shapes required by the writing system of the language. Unused shapes of a traditional alphabet or writing system are modified to produce the new shapes used by the language. Adapt It Regular works well in these types of fonts.</p>
<p class="BodyText">While Adapt It supports many different character sets, it does not make special provision for entering these characters. Therefore, you must know how to enter the characters before beginning the project. Adapt It can be used with character entry software such as Keyman and with special keyboards.</p>
<h3><a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Managing_Punctuation.htm">Punctuation</a></h3>
<p class="BodyText">Another consideration is the type of punctuation that is required in your languages. Adapt It asks you if you need to adjust the standard set of Latin-based punctuation. You can set up punctuation equivalences if the source and target languages use different symbols.</p>
<h3><a href="../Launching_Adapt_It/Case_dialog.htm">Case</a></h3>
<p class="BodyText">You also need to know if your languages use upper and lower case letters. Adapt It allows you to set the equivalences between the upper and lower case forms of each character. You can do this for the Source and Target languages. You can also specify case equivalences for the Glossing language if you use it.</p>
<h3><a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Standard_Format_Markings/Set_USFM_Preferences.htm">USFM</a></h3>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It supports two forms of SFM (Standard Format Markers). You can use the United Bible Society's USFM 2.0 set, the SILPNG 1998 set, or both. The USFM 2.0 set is the default. If you think you might need to use the SILPNG set, investigate this possibility before starting the project. It is best if you can make this determination before setting Filtering of SFM.</p>
<h3><a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Filtering/Set_filtering_preferences.htm">Filtering</a></h3>
<p class="BodyText">Filtering allows you to hide certain SMF markers without eliminating them from the Source text. For example, if you do not need to see any footnotes in the adaptation process, you can hide them and their associated information by specifying that the \f footnote marker be filtered out.</p>
