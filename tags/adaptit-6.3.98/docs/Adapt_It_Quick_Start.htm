<p>This document will give you a summary of the main 
operations you can expect to do when adapting source text Scriptures into a 
target language. If you need extra details, see Adapt It Reference.doc and the Adapt It Tutorial.doc files. If 
you are a translation program administrator, please see the Help for Administrators documentation. An 
extensive HTML help system is also available from the Help Topics item on 
Adapt It's Help menu. <br>
<br>
Mostly, to save space, we refer just to Adapt It. But whatever you read also 
applies equally to Adapt It Unicode.</p>
<p><font size="2"></font><a name="Launching"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b><a 
name=Preparations></a> 
 Preparations for using Adapt It</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The latest version of 
Adapt It is always available at: <a 
href="http://adapt-it.org">http://adapt-it.org</a>&nbsp;(Windows and Mac OS X), 
or <a href="http://packages.sil.org">http://packages.sil.org</a> 
(Linux).</font></p>
<p>Does the source language text or the language that those 
texts are to be adapted into require Unicode? If so, you should download the 
Unicode version of Adapt It, and the computer being used should already have 
fonts installed that display those languages correctly.</p>
<p><font size="3">Are you currently 
using, or planning to use</font><font size="3">&nbsp;Adapt It 
with Paratext or Bibledit? If so, you should refer to the <a 
href="Help_for_Administrators.htm">Help for Administrators</a> document for 
detailed information on setting up setting up your Paratext or Bibledit projects 
and setting up Adapt It to collaborate with one of those Scripture editors.</font></p>
<p>Do you have access to the source texts that you will use 
to adapt from? If those texts are not already stored in a Paratext or a Bibledit 
project you should consider importing them into Paratext or Bibledit before 
working with Adapt It. If you have no plans to use either Paratext or Bibledit, 
you should have those source texts accessible to the computer on which you plan 
to run Adapt It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Launching"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Launching 
Adapt It for the first time</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do one of these things, depending on which computing 
  system you have:<br>* <strong>Windows</strong>:&nbsp;If you have installed 
  Adapt It, or Adapt It Unicode, from an installer, suitable shortcuts will have 
  been made already, and a program group will have been inserted in the All 
  Programs list of the Start button. Click on the start menu item, or 
  double-click on a short cut item to launch Adapt It.<br>* 
  <strong>Linux</strong>: If you installed Adapt It from a Debian package, an 
  Adapt It menu item will be located in the Office group of the Applications 
  menu. Click on the Adapt It menu item to launch Adapt It.<br>* <strong>Mac OS 
  X</strong>              
        : If you installed Adapt It from a 
  disk image (dmg), an Adapt It.app bundle will be located in the mounted 
  disk image. You can copy Adapt It.app to&nbsp;the Applications folder&nbsp;or to 
  anywhere else you want to locate it.&nbsp;You might want to add Adapt It to the 
  Dashboard.&nbsp;Start Adapt It as you would any other Mac program.&nbsp; <br><b>Click </b>the <b>OK</b> button in the<b> Welcome to Adapt It </b>window to hide it. The 
  Startup Wizard will appear. 
  <li>What Adapt It shows next will depend on whether an 
  administrator has configured Adapt It to automatically exchange data with 
  Paratext or Bibledit:<br>* If Adapt It is set up to collaborate with Paratext 
  or Bibledit, you will see the "<strong>Select Source Text from 
  Paratext/Bibledit Project</strong>" dialog. You will use this dialog regularly 
  to obtain books and chapters of books to adapt. If&nbsp;the dialog&nbsp;does 
  not appear when you want to open a different book/chapter, you can&nbsp;open 
  the <strong>File</strong> menu and select "<strong>Open... (Get Source Text 
  From Paratext/Bibledit)</strong>". Once you have gotten a Scripture text to 
  work on, skip down to the next section called "<strong>Typing, deleting and 
  selecting in the phrase box</strong>" to continue.<br>* If Adapt It is NOT set 
  up to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, you will see the "<strong>Start 
  Working</strong>" Wizard from which you can select <strong>&lt;New 
  Project&gt;</strong> or <strong>any appropriate project</strong> that is 
  listed on that "Choose a Project" page.
  <li>If a suitable&nbsp;Adapt It project already exists, 
  <strong>select&nbsp;the project</strong>&nbsp;and press the <strong>Next 
  &gt;</strong> button.
  <li>If there is no suitable project already listed, 
  select the&nbsp; <b>&lt;New Project&gt;</b> item and press 
  the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> button. 
  <li>If you selected an existing project, the wizard's 
  "<strong>Choose a Document</strong>" page will appear. If you need to create a 
  new document from a source language text, click on <strong>&lt;New 
  Document&gt;</strong>, locate the source file to input, and click the wizard's 
  "<strong>Finish</strong>" button. Adapt It will ask you to confirm (or adjust) 
  the name that it will use for the adaptation document's file name. If instead, 
  you want to continue working on a document you created earlier, simply 
  <strong>click on its name in the list</strong>, and click on the wizard's 
  "<strong>Finish</strong>" button. Adapt It will display the source text of the 
  document, ready for you to enter&nbsp;adaptations (see sections below). 
  <li>If you selected <strong>&lt;New Project&gt;</strong> 
  above at the first wizard page, Adapt It will present to you several more 
  wizard pages to collect the information it needs to create the project. These 
  wizard pages will be presented in order:<br><strong>a)</strong>&nbsp;The 
  "<strong>Define Source and Target Language Names</strong>" page 
  appears.&nbsp;Type the <strong>source language name</strong> in the top text 
  box, and the <strong>target language name</strong> in the bottom box. You can 
  also enter the language codes if you know them, or use the "Lookup Codes" 
  button to search for language codes from a list of all the world's 
  languages/codes. Entering these codes here is optional (but helpful if you 
  expect to export a knowledge base in LIFT format (for use by WeSay, or FLEX). 
  Click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong>
               button. <br><strong>b)</strong> The "<strong>Choose Fonts and Font 
  Characteristics</strong>" page appears. If&nbsp;the default font is not 
  suitable&nbsp;you can click on the "Change Font..." buttons to change the font 
  names, font sizes, etc., for each of the Source Font Data, the Target Font 
  Data, and the "Navigation Font Data" sections. Do not tick the check boxes to 
  cause the language text to read Right to Left, unless you are certain that the 
  language requires Right to Left text rendering. You can also use the "Set ... 
  Color..." buttons to change the font text colors if the default colors are not 
  suitable. Click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong>
               button. <br><strong>c)</strong> The "<strong>Define Source and Target 
  Punctuarion Correspondences</strong>" page appears.&nbsp; If the source or 
  target language use punctuation characters that are not listed by default, you 
  can add&nbsp;any punctuation characters you will need for your work&nbsp;to 
  the appropriate cells of the chart. Removing any of those not needed for your 
  work is also quite acceptable. Any characters not in the&nbsp;this 
  chart&nbsp;will be regarded by Adapt It as "word-building" characters, and 
  will remain within words seen in the main window and be saved to the knowledge 
  base. Characters that are defined here as punctuation characters are never put 
  in the knowledge base. Click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> 
  button.<br><strong>d)</strong> The "<strong>Define Any Lower To Upper Case 
  Equivalences</strong>" page appears. If the source language texts you will be 
  working with contain both upper and lower case letters, tick the first check 
  box. If you want Adapt It to automatically capitalize a word-initial lower 
  case letter when appropriate in the target language texts you will be 
  producing, tick the second check box. Three edit boxes appear in which you can 
  indicate the lower case - upper case corresponding pairs for the Source 
  Language, the Target Language, and a Gloss Language. Follow the instructions 
  given on the page. You may find it helpful to click on the "Set English 
  Equivalences" buttons to start with. Doing so will automatically enter the 
  English lower case - upper case pairs. You can then edit the English 
  correspondence pairs to suit the needs of your source and target language. 
  Other buttons under the lists may also be useful in completing the lists. 
  Click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> button.<br><strong>e)</strong> The 
  "<strong>Define USFM and Marker Filtering (Marker Hiding)</strong>" page 
  appears. You can safely leave this page with its default settings. Click the 
  <strong>Next &gt;</strong> button.<br><strong>f)</strong> The "<strong>Choose 
  a Document</strong>" page appears. To create a new document from a source 
  language text, click on <strong>&lt;New Document&gt;. </strong>Locate the 
  source file to input, and click the wizard's "<strong>Finish</strong>" button. 
  Adapt It will ask you to confirm (or adjust) the name that it will use for the 
  adaptation document's file name. Adapt It 
  will display the source text of the document, ready for you to enter adaptations 
  (see sections below). </li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Fail_when_launched"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>If 
Adapt It fails to run</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try launching again, but this time hold down the SHIFT key before you 
  start the launch, and keep it held down for a while - until you see the 
  Welcome to Adapt It window displayed would be long enough. <br>
  (When SHIFT is held down, Adapt It will not read program settings from the 
  configuration files which have been stored when the program was last closed 
  down. It will instead use default settings. If the stored settings had 
  errors, then this procedure will get the application running. However, you 
  will have to set up your fonts, colours and other settings again.) <br>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="Typing_deleting_selecting"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Typing, deleting, and selecting in the phrase 
box</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>phrase box</b> is where 
  you type your adaptations. The phrase box will automatically appear when you 
  click with the mouse pointer in the area directly under words in the source 
  text line in the main window. You might prefer to think of adaptations as 
  "translations". Both words mean the same thing. The active location is 
  wherever the phrase box happens to be at any time. 
  <li><b>Click in the phrase box</b>. 
  Then you will be able to type there. Most commands that you give Adapt It 
  require that the cursor be in the phrase box. If a command does not work, 
  click in the phrase box, and then try the command again. 
  <li>When you type in the phrase box, it will grow longer 
  as your text grows longer. 
  <li>If you delete text in the phrase box, the box will 
  get shorter. The <b>BACKSPACE</b> key will delete text to 
  the left of the cursor. The <b>DEL</b> key will delete 
  text to the right of the cursor. 
  <li>To select a word in the phrase box, <b 
  >double-click</b> it. Or you can <b 
  >single-click at the start and drag the mouse to the 
  end</b> while still holding down the left mouse button, then release the mouse 
  button. 
  <li>To quickly select several consecutive words in the 
  phrase box; <b>double-click on the first</b> one you want 
  to select, then hold down the <b>SHIFT</b> key while you 
  <b>double-click on the last</b> one you want to be 
  selected. All the words between those two words will also become selected. 
  <li>When you have finished typing the translation you 
  want into the phrase box, press the <b>ENTER</b> key. 
  Adapt It will then put your new translation in its special memory location 
  (called the "<b>knowledge base</b>"), and the phrase box 
  will move to the next "empty" location after the current position. An "empty" 
  location is one which does not yet have any adaptation text there. 
  <li><b>You can type punctuation 
  too</b>. If you don't type any punctuation, Adapt It will try to automatically 
  put punctuation in your translated text for you, using the punctuation in the 
  source text and its location to guide it on where to put it, and what 
  punctuation should be used. If Adapt It finds some punctuation in the source 
  text, but you have typed different punctuation in the phrase box, Adapt It 
  will use what you typed and ignore the source text punctuation.<br 
  ><br>If you are using Adapt It with 
  the setting in which punctuation is not shown, you can still type the 
  punctuation you want in the phrase box and the application will accept it and 
  use it properly, though once the phrase box moves you won't see the 
  punctuation – unless, of course, you change the setting. <br 
  >The toolbar buttons for showing or hiding punctuation 
  are: <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt_It_Quick_Start/Image19.gif" width="24" height="23" >and <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt_It_Quick_Start/Image20.gif" width="24" height="23" > We strongly 
  recommend that you always use the setting that has punctuation visible. 
</li></ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a 
name=Moving_forward></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Moving forward to an empty 
location</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure the cursor is in the phrase box. If it is 
  not, click in the phrase box. 
  <li>Press the <b>ENTER</b> key. <br 
  >Note that a "lookup" of the KB is done when you use the 
  ENTER key - the lookup happens after the box is placed at the next suitable 
  location and just before you see the box contents. The TAB key works the same 
  as the ENTER key. </li></ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a 
name=Looking_ahead></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Looking ahead to insert a 
translation</b></font></p>
<p>Adapt It is always "looking ahead" whenever you press 
the <b>ENTER</b> key to make the phrase box move forwards 
in the document. This is an automatic process, you don't have to do anything to 
make it happen. The process takes place every time you press the ENTER key, or 
click somewhere to place the phrase box there.</p>
<p>You can't see any of the following things happening, but 
this is what Adapt It is doing 'under the hood' after you have pressed the ENTER 
key. It first looks at the source text which follows the current active location 
– constructing ten phrases: the first will have 10 words, the second will have 9 
words, the third 8 words, and so on until the last phrase will be just a single 
word. Then, starting with the longest of those constructed phrases, and taking 
each in turn, it looks inside its "memory" (the knowledge base) to see if it can 
find a matching source phrase. If it finds a match, and that stored source 
phrase has only a single translation in the target language, then that 
translation will automatically be inserted into the document – after any needed 
merging is (automatically) done.</p>
<p>If Adapt It finds a source phrase which has more than 
one possible adaptation, it will put up a dialog called <b>Choose Translation</b> – and all the translations currently 
known for that source phrase will be shown to you. <br>a) 
You choose one by <b>double-clicking</b> it, or <br>b) <b>single-click</b> one and click 
the <b>OK</b> button, or <br>c) <b>type a different translation</b> and click <b>OK</b> <br>(it will then be inserted 
in the document at the active location).</p>
<p>If Adapt It does not find any matching word or phrase in 
the knowledge base, it stops looking ahead and instead it does the following 
operations:<br><br>First, it copies 
the source text word (provided the Copy Source toggle is ON - which is the 
default setting) into an internal temporary location. If a consistent changes 
table is not being used (the&nbsp;normal case), the source text word is 
submitted to Adapt It's Guesser function.&nbsp;If the guesser comes up with a 
likely form of the target text, the form is shown to you in the phrase box - 
with an orange background to signal that the form being shown has come from 
Adapt It's guesser. If a guessed form is not a good guess, simply hit the ESC 
key and the contents of the phrase box will revert to what it would have been 
without the guess from the guesser.&nbsp;If a consistent changes table is being 
used, Adapt It does not automatically submit the source word to the guesser. 
Instead,&nbsp;it puts a single space before and after the copied word (these are 
for potential use by consistent changes to make context-sensitive consistent 
changes work properly, such as word-initial changes, or word-final changes), 
then&nbsp;it tries doing those changes on the data. After all changes have 
applied, or if no consistent changes processing has been requested, the 
temporary spaces at the ends are stripped back off. Adapt It then leaves the 
phrase box at the current location waiting for you to do something more - such 
as edit the word, or merge to make a phrase, or accept the word unchanged, 
etc.</p>
<p><a name="Auto_inserting"></a><font 
color=#000080 face=Arial><b>Automatic 
inserting of existing translations (Automatic, Drafting, 
Reviewing)</b></font></p>
<p>There is a checkbox in the mode bar above the main 
window which has the label <b>Automatic</b>. </p>
<p>The default setting is that automatic insertion mode is 
turned ON. This means that Adapt It will jump to the next empty location and 
insert a translation there (if it can find a suitable one), and then move on to 
the next empty location and repeat the process.</p>
<p>If you want Adapt It to enter <b>Single Step </b>mode – then just </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>click</b> the <b 
  >Automatic</b> checkbox so that it is turned OFF. (It is 
  OFF when the box is empty) </li></ul>
<p>In <b>Automatic insertion </b>mode 
Adapt It does not wait for you to do anything. It looks up translations in the 
knowledge base and puts them in for you automatically, one after another without 
stopping. It will stop only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>There is no translation for the source text in the 
  knowledge base yet, or 
  <li>The source text is in the knowledge base, but it has 
  more than one possible translation. <br>If this happens, 
  then Adapt It will show you the <b>Choose Translation</b> 
  dialog, and you can then choose the translation you want inserted in the 
  document, or type a new one. When you click <b>OK</b> to 
  close the dialog, your chosen translation is inserted and then Adapt It goes 
  on automatically inserting more translations. </li></ol>
<p><b>You can cause automatic 
inserting to stop by clicking anywhere in the main window</b> (that's the best 
way), or by clicking the checkbox again, or by pressing any key (this is not so 
good, because the phrase box contents get erased and the key you typed gets 
inserted somewhere – which is almost certainly not what you want to happen).</p>
<p>The mode bar also has buttons for <strong>Drafting</strong> versus <strong>Reviewing</strong> modes. Drafting mode is the default; it 
is the mode in which you will do most of your work. These two buttons affect how 
Adapt It will interpret the <strong>Automatic</strong> 
checkbox. When <strong>Drafting</strong> is turned on, 
Automatic insertion works as above. When <strong>Reviewing</strong> is turned on, then when you press the 
ENTER key the phrase box will not jump to the next empty location, but just go 
to the immediately following location. The latter behaviour is useful when you 
are reviewing your work - it would be a nuisance if each time you hit the ENTER 
key the application would jump the phrase box to a location which might be 
chapters later in the document than where you are reviewing. Note: lookup of the 
knowledge base does not work when you are in Reviewing mode and you hit the 
ENTER key. If you find that the application is not automatically putting in 
translations for you, check if you are in Reviewing mode - if so, click on the 
Drafting button and all should then work as you expect.</p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a 
name=Selecting></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Selecting</b></font></p>
<p>There are three ways to select. Selections always are 
made in the source text, for each of the three selection methods.</p>
<p><font size="3"><u>Way 1: Selecting forwards or backwards starting from the 
Phrase Box, using the ALT key.</u></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold down the ALT key and press the right arrow key –

  down ALT and press the left arrow key instead. 
  <li>Repeat the above step as many times as necessary 
  until you have the required selection. 
  <li>If you encounter a place where there is punctuation

<p>You can enter or leave glossing mode at any time, and as 
often as you want. The "glosses" can be anything you like, such as linguistic 
glosses, or the meaning of the source text expressed in some other language than 
the target text's language. Punctuation DOES get saved within the glossing 
knowledge base - if you don't want this to happen there is a command in the 
Advanced menu that will make Adapt It strip off any punctuation before the store 
operation is done. Adapt It uses the target text punctuation characters for use 
with the glossing language.<br><br>If 
you are in adapting mode and you want to enter glossing mode, do the 
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <b>Advanced</b> menu 
  click <b>See Glosses</b>. A <strong 
  >Glossing </strong>checkbox will appear at the right end 
  of the mode lbar. The application can now show glosses but is still in 
  adapting mode when the glossing checkbox remains unticked. 
  <li>Click the <b>glossing</b> 
  checkbox to turn glossing mode on. When the checkbox is ticked, everything you 
  type will be interpreted as a gloss, and will be stored in the glossing 
  knowledge base. When in glossing mode, you cannot do mergers or 
  retranslations, and you cannot insert placeholders. </li></ul>
<p>If you want to leave glossing mode to reenter adapting 
mode, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>glossing</b> 
  checkbox again, to remove the tick. Adapting mode recommences immediately, but 
  glosses can still be seen, though they cannot be edited. Or... 
  <li>In the <b>Advanced</b> menu 
  click <b>See Glosses</b> again, to remove the tick. 
  Adapting mode will recommence immediately, the <b 
  >Glossing</b> checkbox will disappear, and glosses will 
  not be visible - however the glossing knowledge base remains and is ready for 
  use if you later turn glossing back on. The display will hide the glosses line 
  and revert to two lines. </li></ul>
<p><b><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial"><a name="Automatic capitalization">Automatic capitalization</a></font></b></p>
<p>In automatic capitalization mode the application will 
allow you to type a word or phrase beginning with a lower case letter, and if 
the source text begins with a capital letter at that location then the first 
letter you type in the adaptation phrase box will be changed automatically to 
the appropriate capital letter. In this mode knowledge base entries are stored 
in lower case only. This mode can be turned off or on at any time, and as often 
as desired. The setting you currently have in effect when the project is closed 
will be retained in the project's configuration file. Automatic capitalization 
will work only if the source text's language distinguishes between upper and 
lower case. Adapt It only looks at the first character; if you need a capital 
letter in a position which is not first in the word or phrase you type, you must 
type that capital letter explicitly.</p>
<p>To set up automatic capitalization do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> menu click 
  the <b>Automatic Capitalization...</b> command. 
  <li>A <b>message box</b> will ask 
  you if the source language distinguishes upper and lower case letters. You 
  must click the <b>Yes</b> button for automatic 
  capitalization mode to begin. If the source language does not distinguish 
  between upper and lower case, or you have not defined any case 
  correspondences, just click the <b>No</b> button. Adapt 
  It will refer you to the "<strong>Case</strong>" tab in 
  the Edit Preferences dialog which is accessible from the Edit menu. If your 
  source text language distinguishes between lower and upper case and you wish 
  to have Adapt It use automatic capitalization for the adaptation text, go to 
  the "Case" tab page in Edit Preferences to set up the correspondences between 
  lower and upper case. Fill out the lists.&nbsp; A <b 
  >Set&nbsp;English Equivalences</b> button will fill the 
  list with English equivalences, otherwise type in what you need manually. 
  <li>If you are doing glossing and you have chosen to use 
  the navigation text's font for the glossing, specify the case pairs for the 
  navigation text's language as well in the third list. If the required 
  correspondences are the same or similar to English ones, buttons can help you 
  fill the lists quickly. If you want some letters not automatically 
  capitalized, leave them out of the appropriate list. </li></ul>

a wrong translation used many times already</b></font></p>
<p>Sometime you may realize that a translation for a 
certain source word, or a certain source phrase, is not correct and you want to 
fix it everywhere it occurs in all the document files. Or it might be correct in 
some places, but incorrect in other places. Here is how to "split" an 
adaptation, to fix a wrong adaptation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Tools</b> menu 
  <li>Click the <b>Knowledge Base 
  Editor…</b> command 
  <li><b>Click</b> whichever <b 
  >tab</b> has the source word or source phrase with the 
  wrong translation 
  <li>In the left list box, scroll till you find the source 
  word or phrase, or start typing it in the text box at the bottom left which is 
  labeled "Type Key To Be Found"; when you see it, <b 
  >select</b> it. (The right list box will then show all the 
  translations, including the one which is not correct.) 
  <li><b>Click the incorrect 
  translation</b> to select it. 
  <li>Click the <b>Remove</b> button, 
  to remove it from the knowledge base. 
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button, to 
  close the window and cause the knowledge base to be updated on the disk. (You 
  have deliberately produced an inconsistency between the knowledge base and the 
  adaptations within the documents. Now you can exploit this fact.) 
  <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> menu. 
  <li>Click the <b>Consistency 
  Check…</b> command. Choose whether you want to do the check in just the 
  current document (not recommended), or in this and other documents (highly 
  recommended), then click the <b>OK</b> button. 
  <li>If you clicked the "this and other documents" option, 
  in the dialog which appears don't move any files to the right hand side if you 
  want to make all your documents consistent with the changes you are wanting to 
  put into effect; just immediately click the <b>OK</b> 
  button. <br>(Adapt It will now check every document you 
  have created. The removed translation will no longer be found in the knowledge 
  base, only in the documents, which is an inconsistency. So every instance of 
  that inconsistency will now be found, one after another in all the chosen 
  documents.) 
  <li>Every time the inconsistency is found, Adapt It will 
  show a dialog which allows you to <b>fix the 
  inconsistency</b>; and the main window will show you where the inconsistency 
  occurs.<br>If you want to fix the inconsistency the same 
  way every time, click the checkbox with the label:<br><b 
  >Auto-fix later instances the same way</b> then you will 
  not be asked to fix later instances of the same error, instead Adapt It will 
  fix them for you automatically.<br>If you want to "split" 
  an adaptation into two or more different adaptations, then each time you see 
  the inconsistency, you would either accept the old adaptation, or double-click 
  a different one in the list, or type a new one if there was no suitable one in 
  the list. You would NOT use the <b>Auto-fix later 
  instances the same way</b> if you are splitting an adaptation, instead you 
  have to go do each change manually. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Recover_from_corrupt_KB"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>How to recover from a corrupted knowledge 
base.</b></font></p>
<p>If for some reason your knowledge base has become 
corrupted, you can recover quickly and easily. Knowledge base corruption is not 
a problem that Adapt It has, however, hard drives are not totally reliable and a 
sector might go bad, resulting in a corrupted KB file. Adapt It can recreate the 
knowledge base very quickly from your existing documents. Do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get Adapt It running. 
  <li><strong>Ensure that&nbsp;the 
  project with the corrupted knowledge base is open</strong>. An easy way to do 
  this is to select the project from the <strong>Choose a 
  Project</strong> page in&nbsp;the Start Working Wizard, and then <strong 
  >Cancel</strong> the Wizard when you reach the Choose a 
  Document page. 
  <li>Click the <b>File</b> menu 
  <li>Click the <b>Restore Knowledge 
  Base…</b> command 
  <li>A message box will come up telling you about what you 
  are about to do, and giving you a chance to back out. Don't back out, unless 
  you don't want to restore the knowledge base. 
  <li>Another message box will come up giving you the 
  chance to restore some special settings. This is for advanced users only. 
  Probably it is easiest if you click the <b>No</b> button, 
  it is not very likely that you will have any of those settings in your 
  knowledge base anyway. (See the Adapt It Reference documentation for a more 
  detailed explanation.) 
  <li>Adapt It will show you a dialog which lists all your 
  document files for that project. You should leave all of them in the left hand 
  side list box for best results. <br>(Any that you are 
  certain contain no useful adaptations, you can use the top 'X' button in the 
  dialog to move those files to the right hand side. Those files won't be used 
  in the restoration process.) 
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button when 
  you are ready for the restoration to begin.<br>(Adapt It 
  will do the restoration, create a new knowledge base, save it to disk, install 
  it also in memory, and report what it has done; then you will be ready to 
  continue working on documents.) </li></ul>
<p>You can <b>restore</b> the 
knowledge base in the above manner<b> even if it is not 
corrupted</b>.<br><br>For instance, if 
your knowledge base contains rubbish adaptations from when you were just playing 
with the program for the first time and making document files which have no 
permanent value, mixed together with good adaptations from doing real work on 
scripture files, then you can do a restoration to get rid of the rubbish data. 
Just move the files with the rubbish translations to the right hand list box in 
the second-last step. When finished, your new knowledge base will contain only 
the good translations that you want to keep permanently.</p>

name=Handling_punctuation_properly></a><font color="#000080" 
face=Arial><b>Handling punctuation 
properly</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Adapt It will copy the 
source text punctuation over to the translation automatically</font><font size="4">, </font><font size="3">so you normally 
do not need to type punctuation. Just let Adapt It insert it for you.</font></p>
<p>Sometimes this automatic punctuation does not give you 
the results you want. <br>Here are the possibilities:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The location for the punctuation is correct, but you 
  want a different kind of punctuation there; or 
  <li>Adapt It is copying punctuation, but you don't want 
  any at that point in the translation; or 
  <li>Adapt It is copying punctuation, some of it is 
  correct, and some of it is not what you want; or 
  <li>the target language uses a kind of punctuation which 
  is different than in the source language, so the copying of source text 
  punctuation gives the wrong result. <br>(Note: source 
  text punctuation is not actually "copied", but rather Adapt It looks at the 
  table of punctuation correspondences you set up with the <b 
  >Source and Target Punctuation Correspondences</b> dialog 
  and for each source punctuation character it determines what the appropriate 
  target text punctuation character should be. If there is nothing listed for 
  that source punctuation character, nothing is transferred to the target text.) 
  </li></ol>
<p>Here are the ways you can handle these problems:</p>
<p>For problem (a):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where the copied punctuation would appear, in the 
  phrase box type the punctuation you want to occur at that part of the text. 
  <br>(Your typed punctuation will be used instead, and 
  Adapt It will not insert the corresponding target punctuation.) </li></ul>
<p>For problem (b):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the Edit menu's Edit Source Text command, and 
  in the dialog edit out the punctuation from the source text. (This is not an 
  ideal solution, but it may suffice if source text changes don't matter. Or you 
  can use the alternative but longer method below.) <br 
  >(The punctuation in the source text at the active 
  location is removed so Adapt It will no longer try to insert any punctuation 
  into the target text at that location. NOTE: if you later want to Export the 
  source text, DO NOT use this method, instead use the following method.) 
  <li>Alternatively, from the Edit menu, click on Edit 
  Preferences... and then click on the Punctuation tab. In the punctuation lists 
  remove the target text punctuation which corresponds to the source text 
  punctuation you don't want to be copied at this location. Close the dialog. 
  Then hit ENTER to move the phrase box to the next location. Then again open 
  the Edit Preferences... item and access the Punctuation tab,&nbsp;put back the 
  target punctuation character(s) you removed above - DON'T FORGET to do this 
  step! Close the dialog and continue working. (This method leaves the source 
  text unchanged, and so any subsequent export of the source text will produce 
  correctly punctuated source text data.) </li></ul>
<p>For problem (c)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use one of the preceding alternatives, preferably the 
  second - except you may need to temporarily delete more than one target 
  punctuation character from the dialog. Remember to replace them after you have 
  moved the phrase box on to the next location. </li></ul>
<p>For problem (d)</p>
<ul>
  <li>You don't have a needed punctuation correspondence 
  set up yet. Fix it by opening the <strong>Edit 
  Preferences...</strong> dialog from the Edit menu, access the <strong 
  >Punctuation</strong> tab,&nbsp;and type the needed 
  correspondence into the left pair of columns. Note, in the source list each 
  unique punctuation character may only appear ONCE. In the target list you can 
  have more than one instance of the same punctuation character. Then close the 
  dialog and continue with your work. </li></ul>
<p>If you do choose to use the Edit menu's "Edit Source 
Text" please note: editing the source text is not something you should do 
without careful consideration beforehand, and careful manual text management - 
such as archiving of the original source text before any editing is done on a 
copy of it. It would be easy to lose track of what constitutes the true source 
text if you are not careful.</p>

keyboard shortcut <b>CTRL+S</b>.</p>
<p>If you don't want to be bothered by having to 
occasionally save your work, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> menu. 
  <li>Click the <b>Preferences</b>…

  and knowledge base <b>after a certain time has 
  elapsed</b>; or <br>b) it can save them <b 
  >after the phrase box has moved to a new location a 
  certain number of times</b>. <br>(If you are adapting 
  quickly, a time setting - such as every two minutes will protect your work 
  best. <br>If you are working slowly, or are just learning 
  to use the program, saving every few dozen moves might be a better choice. <br 
  >You can change these settings at any time, or turn them

"Export Translation Text..." while Adapt It is collaborating with Paratext or 
Bibledit. If you are not using Paratext or Bibledit, and need to export your 
translation for some other purpose you can do the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export-Import 
  </strong>menu. 
  <li>Click the <b>Export Translation 
  Text…</b> command. A dialog will open and give you the choice between 
  exporting the text as standard format marked text, or as a rich text format 
  (RTF) document with the standard format markers changed to publication 
  standard styles according to the Scripture Template. Choose the option which 
  suits your purpose. If you want to use the exported data for a backtranslation 
  project, then choose the standard format option. If you want to print the 
  translation in a nice readable publication-standard format, use the RTF 
  option. Then a standard Windows <b>file dialog</b> will 
  open, with a suggested output filename (your document's name, or if you want 
  the RTF option, it will have .rtf appended to the name), and a destination 
  folder and disk drive. 
  <li>Use the <b>file dialog</b> to 
  change the filename if you wish, and the folder where you want the file saved 
  to if the suggested location is not suitable. 
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button. <br 
  >Adapt It will then create the file and fill it with the 
  translated text. You don't have to have the translation of the whole document 
  finished before you use the Export Translation Text… command. If it is not 
  finished, then some of the verses will just not have any text in them. 
</li></ul>
<p>When you export the document, you will end up with a 
separate file containing only the target language translated text, with all the 
SIL standard format markers replaced in their correct positions, or with an rtf 
file you can then read into any word processor and print from there. </p>
<p>Adapt It may put up a dialog during the export process 
if it needs your help to know where to replace some of the markers. This will 
happen only if you merged source words across the location where a marker 
occurred, or if a marker lies within a retranslation.</p>
<p>A similar command, <strong>Export 
Source Text...</strong>, will allow you to export only the source text, with 
standard format markers automatically replaced, or as RTF. You would normally 
only use this command if you had earlier used the <strong>Edit Source Text</strong> command to change the source text

<p>Note: If Adapt It is setup to collaborate with Paratext 
or Bibledit, you will not need to manually open documents within Adapt It. 
Instead you will simply choose a Scripture book and chapter to adapt from the 
Get Source Text from Paratext/Bibledit Project" dialog. If you are not 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>File</b> menu 
  <li>Click the <strong>Start 
  Working... </strong>command 
  <li>If you are shown the <strong 
  >Choose a Project</strong> page, then you do not yet have 
  a project open; if so, select the project which contains the document you want 
  to open, and click the <strong>Next &gt; </strong>button. 
  You will then see the <b>Choose a Document </b>page. 
  <li><b>Select the document you want 
  to open. </b>You might have to scroll the list box to see it. Then <strong 
  >click on the Finish button.</strong> </li></ul>
<p>You can also go to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list at 
the bottom of the File menu, and double-click the document you wish to open. If 
the document is in another project, Adapt It will close the current project 
(asking you about saving the document and KB first if necessary) for you, and 
then open the other project and the requested document. This is a convenient and 
fast way to switch documents and projects with the one double-click.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In 
addition to exporting your translation work, Adapt It allows you to export the 
knowledge base, and other types of data from your project and its 
documents:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Exporting your knowledge base 
data.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge base data can be exported in two different 
formats: Standard format (SFM) or LIFT format. </font></p>
<p>a) <strong>SFM format 
exports.</strong> <font face="Times New Roman">The export 
of a knowledge base in SFM automatically uses <b>\lx and 
\ge standard format markers</b>, the <strong>\lx</strong> 
marker will have source text following it, then one or more following <strong>\ge</strong> markers will contain the one or several 
possible adaptations (or glosses, if the application is in glossing mode) for 
the source text in the preceding \lx field. the standard format exports 
also&nbsp;uses&nbsp;other date-time&nbsp;and deletion markers including <span 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"

lang=EN-AU> </span>format markers. See the Adapt It 
Reference document for more details.</font></p>
<p>b) <strong>LIFT format 
exports.</strong> The export of knowledge base data in LIFT format can be used 
to import lexical data directly into the WeSay or FLEX programs.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To 
export a knowledge base:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">On 
  the <strong>Export-Import </strong>menu, click the <b 
  >Export Knowledge Base...</b> command. Turn glossing mode 
  on if you want the glossing knowledge base exported, otherwise the adapting 
  knowledge base will be exported.</font> 
  <li>A dialog will come up allowing you to specify the 
  type of export: SFM or LIFT. 
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">A 
  file output dialog will come up; choose the filename you want and the 
  destination folder, then click <b>OK</b> to complete the 
  export.</font> </li></ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Exporting your adaptation work 
in Interlinear text.</strong> An interlinear text can show all of the parts of 
your work neatly&nbsp;aligned in tables. The format of interlinear exports is 
Rich Text Format (RTF) in which the navigation text, source text, target text, 
and perhaps also the glossing text and free translation text, (or any 
combination of these) are shown in tables, sized to fit the data in the cells 
correctly. Each table can therefore have either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 rows, depending 
on what data you want exported; and a blank line occurs between each table. The 
length of the tables fits within the printing area of a page, taking the current 
margin settings into account. Landscape or Portrait orientations can be chosen. 
If glossing mode is turned on, the glossing row will be above the adaptations 
row; otherwise the glossing row will occur under the adaptations row.</font></p>
<p>To export Interlinear text:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">On 
  the <strong>Export-Import </strong>menu, click the <b 
  >Export Interlinear Text...</b> command. </font>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">In 
  the dialog which comes up, choose which kinds of data you want exported. (If 
  the gloss text option is disabled, <b>Cancel</b> the 
  dialog, turn glossing on, or make glosses visible - see the <b 
  >Advanced</b> menu, then try again.) Also choose the 
  orientation and specify a range if you don't want all the document exported. 
  (You may want to <b>choose fonts and sizes and styles 
  before using the Export Interlinear Text...</b> command, so that the 
  application will set up the cell sizes correctly.)</font> 
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">A 
  file output dialog will come up; choose the filename you want and the

  would probably only want to export the source text of a document if you have 
  edited the source text because it contained spelling mistakes or other errors. 
  Mostly you will want to export the target text, glosses text and free 
  translations. Export of all of these types of text can be done in one of two 
  ways: either as a plain text file with standard format markers automatically 
  replaced; or as an RTF (Rich Text Format) document in which the replaced 
  standard format markers have been converted automatically to styles using the 
  Scripture Template - this type of exported file can be opened in a word

<p><b><font color="#000080" size="2"

</font><font color="#ff0000" size="2" face="Arial">NOT 
</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial">apply to Adapt 
It nor to Adapt It Unicode! They apply only to the additional "stand-alone" 
Consistent Changes applications included in the installer for Adapt It or Adapt 
It Unicode for your convenience. None of the comments below have any bearing on 
using Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode. If you want to build and test consistent 
changes tables separately from using such tables within Adapt It or Adapt It 
Unicode, then this section will help you to do so - that's the only reason this 
information is here. By "stand-alone" we mean that you can run these cc 
applications without having to run Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The 
Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode installers for Windows also include version 8.1.5 
of the Consistent Changes application as a stand-alone executable. The filename 
is CCW32.exe and it will be found in your Program Files\Adapt It WX\&nbsp; 
folder, and/or in your Program Files\Adapt It WX Unicode\&nbsp; folder - this 
version of CC is compliant with both ASCII and ANSI encodings and also the UTF-8 
encoding. Full documentation for CCW32 will be found, also in the same location, 
in a CC Documentation folder. The folder includes additional documentation for a 
standalone CC debugger application called CCDbg32.exe. Unfortunately this 
debugger application is <b><font color="#ff0000">not</font></b> included with the installation because the 
installer for Adapt It becomes too large. (However, you can request the debugger 
be sent by email from the author - as a compressed executable it is 201 KB in 
size.) Note, these applications both use the CC32.DLL file - the same .DLL file 
which Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode use. So if you move one or both of these cc 
applications to another folder and want to run them from that other folder, be 
sure to <b><font color="#ff0000">copy</font></b> (not move, and not cut and paste) the 
CC32.DLL file to that folder also.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you 
run CCW32, you will see the following window which is divided into 5 sections, 
the first is a command history - it is not important, the next sections allow 
you to specify a working directory, what input data you want processed, what cc 
table is to be used for the processing, and what file the output is to be saved 
in.</font></p>
<p>You should put the cc table file you wish to use in the 
Working Directory - this should be the same directory as contains the CCW32 
application itself. The input and output files can be from and to any folder. 
Use the top Browse button to make the folder containing CCW32 the working 
directory.</p>
<p>In the Input file section, type the name of the input 
(plain text) file which is to be processed if it is located in the working 
directory, or use the Browse button to locate it.</p>
<p>In the Changes file section, type the name of the 
consistent changes table file which is to be used - it must have an .cct 
filename extension to be recognised as a changes file.</p>
<p>In the Output file section, type the name of the wanted 
output file - it will be output to the working directory, but if you want it to 
be sent to a different folder then use the Browse button to tell the application 
which folder to put it in. If the results are not as you expect and you need to 
edit the table and try again, fill out the sections as before, and click the 
"Overwrite existing output" checkbox.</p>
<p>Click the Process button to cause cc processing to 
commence.</p>
<p align="center">________________</p>
<p>Note: in the installation two .cct tables are provided 
for your convenience. Both have been tested.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A table called "reverse_lx_ge.cct". This table will 
  do a "reversal" of the file produced by Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode when you 
  click the "Export Knowledge Base" command. It takes the \lx and \ge fields, 
  changes their order and renames the markers so that in the output file the old 
  \lx fields are now \ge fields, and the old \ge fields are now \lx fields. <br 
  ><br>This table would be useful if 
  you have an existing adaptation project in which you have translated text from 
  language A to language B; and for some reason you want to set up another 
  language project to translate text from language B back to language A. To do 
  this type of job it would be helpful to be able to populate the knowledge base 
  for the B to A adaptations project with all the necessary adaptations data 
  before starting to adapt any documents. This table will allow you to do that. 
  Proceed as follows:<br><br>Use the 
  table in CCW32, and for the input use the file you get from exporting the KB 
  from the A to B adaptations project. Launch Adapt It (or Adapt It Unicode), 
  and then the output of the preceding sentence's process can then be loaded 
  into the KB of the B to A adaptations project by using the "Import to 
  Knowledge Base" command. Then you are ready to begin adapting B text back to 
  language A at full speed and with minimal typing.<br 
  >&nbsp; 
  <li>A table called "table series as one.cct". Adapt It or 
  Adapt It Unicode are designed to optionally handle up to four tables in series 
  - the output from each becoming the input to the next. Sometimes it might be 
  necessary to do an adaptation with more than four tables in series. This 
  "table series as one.cct" table allows you to take the rule contents of three 
  tables and paste them into the appropriate places in this one table. In this 
  way adaptation could be done with up to twelve sub-tables processed in 
  sequence (four tables, each with three sub-tables). The contents of this table 
  could be easily modified to make the table handle more than three sub-tables - 
  so in effect any number of cc tables can be processed in sequence using this 
  table in suitably modified form. The table contains comments which tell you 
  where to paste your sub-table rules. </li></ol>

<li>Either these are advanced topics, or they are not 
essential for successful use of the application for beginners, and can be left 
till later on. For details of anything not covered here, see the Adapt 
It&nbsp;Reference documentation file. Note: the adaptation engine in Adapt It is 
not based on SIL's consistent changes application. Consistent changes is only an 
option; it does not have to be used to do adaptation work successfully; but in 
the hands of someone who knows how to make use of consistent changes it can be a 
powerful extra tool to help automate the translation process - especially if 
there are affixes which change in a regular way or sound changes which result in 
spelling differences of a regular kind. See the full reference documentation for 
more details. </li></dir>
