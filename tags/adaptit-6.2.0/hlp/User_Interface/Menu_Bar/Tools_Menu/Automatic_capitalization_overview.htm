<h2>Automatic Capitalization overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">This feature allows Adapt It to capitalize <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span> words according to the way they are capitalized in the <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> language. However you must establish the equivalences between lower and upper case in each language using the <a href="../../Preferences/Lower_to_Upper_Case_Equivalences.htm">Case</a> table provided in the <a href="../../Preferences/Preferences_dialog.htm">Preferences dialog</a> of the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu or in the <a href="../../../Getting_Started/Launching_Adapt_It/Case_dialog.htm">Case dialog</a> presented by the <a href="../File_Menu/Proj_Mngment/Using_Start_Working.htm">Start Working…</a> wizard at project initialization .</p>
<p class="BodyText">Once you have established these equivalences and <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> is turned on, Adapt It automatically adjusts upper and case letters according to the values established in the table. If you type the adaptation using a lower case letter and the source word is capitalized, Adapt It converts the letter to upper case. Thus, you do not have to make the changes manually each time an upper case letter is required.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> is off, you must type in the upper case letters when needed.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The feature applies only when both the source and target languages require both upper and lower cases. If the source language target language does not distinguish between upper and lower case, you must type target language characters in the appropriate case manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> is on and you enter a new adaptation, the knowledge base (KB) receives only lower case version of a word. If it is off, the KB may contain both an upper case and lower case version of the word. The KB treats each entry as a separate word and alternate adaptations of the basic word do not transfer from the upper case version to the lower case version and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Automatic Capitalization can be turned on or off as frequently as you wish during a session.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Entries to the KB during a session reflect the <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> status when they are entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> status at the end of a session is maintained when the document is reopened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Changing status may result in some extra upper case adaptation entries in the knowledge base. These extra entries do not slow the process and are harmless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Frequent changing of status cannot harm the knowledge base.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If you <a href="../File_Menu/KB_Mngment/Restore_the_knowledge_base.htm">Restore the Knowledge Base</a>, Adapt It uses the current <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> status to determine whether or not it should create upper case entries in the new the glossing knowledge base or the adaptation knowledge base. Adapt It creates upper case entries only when the <span class="UserInterface">Automatic Capitalization</span> is <span class="Emphasis">off</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Automatic Capitalization only looks at the very first character of the source word. If upper case is required at any other place in the target word or phrase, you need to type the upper case character manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the first letter of a source text word is lower case but the target text word requires upper case, you have to type the upper case manually.</p>
