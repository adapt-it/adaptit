<h2>Adapt It Notes overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It Notes feature makes it possible to store consultant notes, advisor notes and exegetical notes within Adapt It documents. Since notes are stored as <a href="../Filtering/Filtering_of_information.htm">filtered information</a> they remain hidden within Adapt It until you want to see them. Like other kinds of filtered information, notes are retained and passed along by default whenever you <a href="../../Adapt_It_Concepts/Exporting_overview.htm">export</a> your documents as <span class="DefinedWord">standard format files</span>. Usually the notes that you or an advisor or a consultant add to your document would also be helpful to a translator who uses your target text as a source text for a related language adaptation project or in a cluster language project.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It makes it easy to handle notes through the use of the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Notes_icons/Add_a_note.htm">Add a note</a></p>
</li>

<p class="BodyText">There can be a problem when propagating Notes and other filtered material. This type of material can block the ability of Adapt It to <a href="../../User_Interface/Phrase_Box/Make_a_phrase.htm">make a phrase</a> if it crosses the boundary of a filtered section. In such cases, you may need to delete the filtered material to make the phrase. With Notes, you can move the note to some other location, go back and make the merger and then move the note back to its proper location.</p>

</ul>
