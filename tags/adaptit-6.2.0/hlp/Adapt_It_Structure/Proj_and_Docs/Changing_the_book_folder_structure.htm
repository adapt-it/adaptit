<h2>Changing the book folder structure</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It comes with a default book folder structure. This structure is based on the books of the Bible including 66 books arranged into four divisions. In addition, it provides a fifth division for "Other Texts."</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It controls this structure by the use of an external XML file called <span class="FileName">books.XML.</span> This file is stored in the <span class="FileName">Adapt It Work Folder</span> or the <span class="FileName">Adapt It Unicode Work Folder</span>. A sample of the file looks like this:</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/books_xml.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText"> This file can be edited if your project needs to use a different structure. In the illustration you can see that each line contains a separate XML instruction. Only two types of XML lines are of interest here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">&lt;DIV …</p>
<p class="BodyText">This code defines the name of a division. To change the name, replace the words within the double quote marks with a new name of your choice.</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">&lt;NAMEPAIR …</p>
<p class="BodyText">All of the entries between two &lt;DIV entries belong to the division. Each of these entries contains three properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Keyboard">Folder</span> gives the name of the folder that is built for the project.</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Keyboard">View</span> is the name that the user reads in using the <a href="../../User_Interface/Dialog_Boxes/Choose_a_Book_folder_dialog.htm">Choose a Book Folder dialog</a>. Usually the same as the folder name.</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Keyboard">Code</span> is a three letter upper case code for the book.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It use this code to verify that any document moved into the folder is valid for that folder. For example, if you want to move a document into the Genesis folder, the first few characters of the source text must read "\id GEN". The SMF \id tells Adapt It that the identification of book is to follow. The GEN tells Adapt It that this document is all or a portion of Genesis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img src="../../warning_icon.gif">&nbsp;Caution</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Since the books.XML file is located in the Work folder it applies to all projects in the folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
