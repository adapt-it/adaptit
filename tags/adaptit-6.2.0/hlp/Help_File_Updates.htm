<p class="BodyText">This set of changes leaves the Help 
  files for pre-6.0&nbsp;Adapt It largely intact. This is&nbsp;the beginning of 
  the changes to&nbsp;bring the&nbsp;files&nbsp;to conform with version 
  6.0.&nbsp;The major items that have been affected include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
<div class="BodyText">  Numerous images have 
    been changed to reflect the&nbsp;6.0 user interface. However, there remain 
    many images that have not been&nbsp;updated. In most cases you should be able 
    to relate the old image to what you see on the screen.</div>
