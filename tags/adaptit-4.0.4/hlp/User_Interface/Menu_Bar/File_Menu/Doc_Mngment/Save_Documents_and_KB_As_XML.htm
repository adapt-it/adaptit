<h2>Save documents and KB as XML</h2>
<p class="BodyText">This option is a control to tell Adapt It if documents should be saved in XML format or in <span class="DefinedWord">binary format</span>. XML is the preferred format, but since earlier version of Adapt It used binary format, there may be some reason to maintain files in that format. Adapt It works equally well with both formats. For more information see <a href="../../../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/XML_in_Adapt_It.htm">XML in Adapt It</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To change the file type of the working documents and knowledge base (KB) do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the <span class="UserInterface">Save Documents and KB As XML</span> entry in the <span class="UserInterface">File</span> menu is checked. Click the item to remove the check mark.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It saves the files, they are saved in <span class="DefinedWord">binary format</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the <span class="UserInterface">Save Documents and KB As XML</span> entry in the <span class="UserInterface">File</span> menu is <span class="Emphasis">not</span> checked. Click the item to restore the check mark.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It saves the files, they are saved in <span class="DefinedWord">XML format</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img src="../../../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The current version of Adapt It reads either XML or binary files. Adapt It 2.4.1i and earlier can only read binary files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The setting for this command determines only what format is used for saving documents from this point on. It does not change the format of previously saved documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It can open either type of file but saves it according to the current setting. Therefore a binary file can be saved as XML or vice versa. However, maintains only one copy of the adaptation file, based on the setting when it was last saved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
