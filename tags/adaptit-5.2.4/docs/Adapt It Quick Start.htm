<p>This document will give you a summary of the main operations you can expect 
to do when adapting source text scriptures into a target language. If you need 
extra details, see Adapt It Basic Ref documentation. Or try working through the 
Adapt It Tutorial files. <br>
<br>
Mostly, to save space, we refer just to Adapt It. But whatever you read also 
applies equally to Adapt It Unicode.</p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Launching"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Launching 
Adapt It for the first time</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do one of these things. The second or third options will not work unless 
  you have shortcuts set up appropriately – see the beginning of the Adapt It 
  Basics documentation for details. If you have installed Adapt It, or Adapt It 
  Unicode, from an installer, suitable shortcuts will have been made already, 
  and a program group will have been inserted in the Programs list of the Start 
  button. You can make additional shortcuts manually if you wish. <br>
  <b>Double-click</b> the <b>AdaptIt.exe</b> file in whatever folder stores the 
  program, or<br>
  <b>Double-click</b> the application <b>shortcut</b>, or <br>
  Click the <b>Start</b> button to find the <b>Programs</b> item, click it, then 
  click the<b> Adapt It</b> item, or the <b>Adapt It Unicode</b> item, depending 
  on whether you want to work with legacy encodings and fonts, or with Unicode 
  and Unicode fonts. </li>
  <li><b>Click </b>the <b>OK</b> button in the<b> Welcome to Adapt It </b>window 
  to hide it. The Startup Wizard will appear. </li>
  <li><b>Double-click</b> the <b>&lt;New Project&gt;</b> item. The wizard's page for 
  setting language names appears.<br>
  a) Type the name of the source text language in the top text box. <br>
  b) Type the name of the target text's language in the bottom text box. <br>
  c) Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button. The wizard's Fonts page will be displayed 
  next. </li>
  <li>If you are happy with the pre-set font and color choices, just click the
  <b>Next&gt;</b> button. <br>
  Otherwise click the <b>Change…</b> buttons, and the buttons for setting 
  colours, to set up whatever source text and target text fonts you want. You 
  can also set font sizes (12 point is a good size), styles (regular and bold is 
  a good choice). It is best to use different colours for source text, target 
  text, navigation text, retranslations, and special text. (You can change any 
  or all of these settings later). Click <b>Next&gt;</b> to go to the wizard's 
  Documents page.</li>
  <li>Before the Documents page opens, you will see a dialog called <b>Define 
  Source and Target Punctuation Correspondences</b>. This dialog is the only 
  place where you can inform Adapt It what the source text punctuation 
  characters are, what the target text punctuation characters are, and what 
  correspondences there needs to be between those two sets of punctuation 
  characters. The dialog will show you Latin punctuation and correspondences by 
  default. Add to these any punctuation characters you need for your work. 
  Removing any of those not needed for your work is also quite acceptable. Any 
  characters not in the lists in that dialog will be regarded by Adapt It as 
  &quot;word-building&quot; characters, and will remain within words seen in the main 
  window and be saved to the knowledge base. Punctuation characters are never 
  put in the knowledge base. You can make this dialog appear at any later time - 
  a command for that purpose is on the Edit menu.</li>
  <li><b>Double-click</b> the <b>&lt;New Document&gt;</b> item. <br>
  You will get a file dialog; use it to find the source text scripture file that 
  you wish to adapt first. When you close the file dialog by clicking the <b>OK</b> 
  button, you will see a small message window. </li>
  <li>In the small message window <b>type the name</b> you want Adapt It to use 
  for the document when it is saved to the computer's hard disk. </li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> to close the small message window. <br>
  Then Adapt It will display the source text and you will be ready to start your 
  adaptation work.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Fail_when_launched"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>If 
Adapt It fails to run</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try launching again, but this time hold down the SHIFT key before you 
  start the launch, and keep it held down for a while - until you see the 
  Welcome to Adapt It window displayed would be long enough. <br>
  (When SHIFT is held down, Adapt It will not read program settings from the 
  configuration files which have been stored when the program was last closed 
  down. It will instead used default settings. If the stored settings had 
  errors, then this procedure will get the application running. However, you 
  will have to set up your fonts, colours and other settings again.) <br>
  If this does not work, contact Bruce at <a href="mailto:bruce_waters@sil.org">
  bruce_waters@sil.org</a> or Bill at <a href="mailto:bill_martin@sil.org">

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Typing_deleting_selecting"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Typing, 
deleting, and selecting in the phrase box</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>phrase box</b> is where you type your adaptations. You might prefer 
  to think of adaptations as &quot;translations&quot;. Both words mean the same thing. The 
  active location is wherever the phrase box happens to be at any time. </li>
  <li><b>Click in the phrase box</b>. Then you will be able to type there. Most 
  commands that you give Adapt It require that the cursor be in the phrase box. 
  If a command does not work, click in the phrase box, and then try the command 
  again. </li>
  <li>When you type in the phrase box, it will grow longer as your text grows 
  longer. </li>
  <li>If you delete text in the phrase box, the box will get shorter. The <b>
  BACKSPACE</b> key will delete text to the left of the cursor. The <b>DEL</b> 
  key will delete text to the right of the cursor. </li>
  <li>To select a word in the phrase box, <b>double-click</b> it. Or you can <b>
  single-click at the start and drag the mouse to the end</b> while still 
  holding down the left mouse button, then release the mouse button. </li>
  <li>To quickly select several consecutive words in the phrase box; <b>
  double-click on the first</b> one you want to select, then hold down the <b>
  SHIFT</b> key while you <b>double-click on the last</b> one you want to be 
  selected. All the words between those two words will also become selected.
  </li>
  <li>When you have finished typing the translation you want into the phrase 
  box, press the <b>ENTER</b> key. Adapt It will then put your new translation 
  in its special memory location (called the &quot;<b>knowledge base</b>&quot;), and the 
  phrase box will move to the next &quot;empty&quot; location after the current position. 
  An &quot;empty&quot; location is one which does not yet have any adaptation text there.
  </li>
  <li><b>You can type punctuation too</b>. If you don't type any punctuation, 
  Adapt It will try to automatically put punctuation in your translated text for 
  you, using the punctuation in the source text and its location to guide it on 
  where to put it, and what punctuation should be used. If Adapt It finds some 
  punctuation in the source text, but you have typed different punctuation in 
  the phrase box, Adapt It will use what you typed and ignore the source text 
  punctuation.<br>
  <br>
  If you are using Adapt It with the setting in which punctuation is not shown, 
  you can still type the punctuation you want in the phrase box and the 
  application will accept it and use it properly, though once the phrase box 
  moves you won't see the punctuation – unless, of course, you change the 
  setting. <br>
  The toolbar buttons for showing or hiding punctuation are:
  <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image19.gif" width="24" height="23">and
  <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image20.gif" width="24" height="23"> 
  We strongly recommend that you always use the setting that has punctuation 
  visible.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Moving_forward"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Moving 
forward to an empty location</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure the cursor is in the phrase box. If it is not, click in the 
  phrase box. </li>
  <li>Press the <b>ENTER</b> key. <br>
  Note that a &quot;lookup&quot; of the KB is done when you use the ENTER key - the lookup 
  happens after the box is placed at the next suitable location and just before 
  you see the box contents. However, no lookup is done if you instead move 
  forward by pressing the <b>TAB</b> key. If you are not getting your old 
  adaptations inserted automatically, then it is probably because you have been 
  moving forward using TAB rather than ENTER.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Looking_ahead"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Looking 
ahead to insert a translation</b></font></p>
<p>Adapt It is always &quot;looking ahead&quot; whenever you press the <b>ENTER</b> key to 
make the phrase box move forwards in the document. This is an automatic process, 
you don't have to do anything to make it happen. However, the process takes 
place <u>only</u> when you press the ENTER key, or click somewhere to place the 
phrase box there. It does <u>not </u>happen if you move around in the document 
by some other method, such as pressing the TAB key.</p>
<p>You can't see any of the following things happening, but this is what Adapt 
It is doing 'under the hood' after you have pressed the ENTER key. It first 
looks at the source text which follows the current active location – 
constructing ten phrases: the first will have 10 words, the second will have 9 
words, the third 8 words, and so on until the last phrase will be just a single 
word. Then, starting with the longest of those constructed phrases, and taking 
each in turn, it looks inside its &quot;memory&quot; (the knowledge base) to see if it can 
find a matching source phrase. If it finds a match, and that stored source 
phrase has only a single translation in the target language, then that 
translation will automatically be inserted into the document – after any needed 
merging is (automatically) done.</p>
<p>If Adapt It finds a source phrase which has more than one possible 
adaptation, it will put up a dialect called <br>
<b>Choose Translation</b> – and all the translations currently known for that 
source phrase will be shown to you. <br>
a) You choose one by <b>double-clicking</b> it, or </p>
<p>b) <b>single-click</b> one and click the <b>OK</b> button, or <br>
c) <b>type a different translation</b> and click <b>OK</b> <br>
(it will then be inserted in the document at the active location).</p>
<p>If Adapt It does not find any matching word or phrase in the knowledge base, 
it stops looking ahead and instead it does the following operations:<br>
<br>
First, it copies the source text word (provided the Copy Source toggle is ON - 
which is the default setting) into an internal temporary location, then it puts 
a single space before and after the copied word (these are for potential use by 
consistent changes to make context-sensitive consistent changes work properly, 
such as word-initial changes, or word-final changes), then if consistent changes 
are turned on, it tries doing those changes on the data. After all changes have 
applied, or if no consistent changes processing has been requested, the 
temporary spaces at the ends are stripped back off and the resulting word is 
shown to you in the phrase box. Adapt It then leaves the phrase box at the 
current location waiting for you to do something more - such as edit the word, 
or merge to make a phrase, or accept the word unchanged, etc.</p>
<p><a name="Auto_inserting"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Automatic 
inserting of existing translations (Automatic, Drafting, Reviewing)</b></font></p>
<p>There is a checkbox in the toolbar above the main window which has the label
<b>Automatic</b>. </p>
<p>The default setting is that automatic insertion mode is turned ON. This means 
that Adapt It will jump to the next empty location and insert a translation 
there (if it can find a suitable one), and then move on to the next empty 
location and repeat the process.</p>
<p>If you want Adapt It to enter <b>Single Step </b>mode – then just </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>click</b> the <b>Automatic</b> checkbox so that it is turned OFF. (It 
  is OFF when the box is empty)</li>
</ul>
<p>In <b>Automatic insertion </b>mode Adapt It does not wait for you to do 
anything. It looks up translations in the knowledge base and puts them in for 
you automatically, one after another without stopping. It will stop only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>There is no translation for the source text in the knowledge base yet, or</li>
  <li>The source text is in the knowledge base, but it has more than one 
  possible translation. <br>
  If this happens, then Adapt It will show you the <b>Choose Translation</b> 
  dialog, and you can then choose the translation you want inserted in the 
  document, or type a new one. When you click <b>OK</b> to close the dialog, 
  your chosen translation is inserted and then Adapt It goes on automatically 
  inserting more translations.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>You can cause automatic inserting to stop by clicking anywhere in the main 
window</b> (that's the best way), or by clicking the checkbox again, or by 
pressing any key (this is not so good, because the phrase box contents get 
erased and the key you typed gets inserted somewhere – which is almost certainly 
not what you want to happen).</p>
<p>The toolbar also has buttons for <strong>Drafting</strong> versus <strong>
Reviewing</strong> modes. Drafting mode is the default; it is the mode in which 
you will do most of your work. These two buttons affect how Adapt It will 
interpret the <strong>Automatic</strong> checkbox. When <strong>Drafting</strong> 
is turned on, Automatic insertion works as above. When <strong>Reviewing</strong> 
is turned on, then when you press the ENTER key the phrase box will not jump to 
the next empty location, but just go to the immediately following location. The 
latter behaviour is useful when you are reviewing your work - it would be a 
nuisance if each time you hit the ENTER key the application would jump the 
phrase box to a location which might be chapters later in the document than 
where you are reviewing. Note: lookup of the knowledge base does not work when 
you are in Reviewing mode and you hit the ENTER key. If you find that the 
application is not automatically putting in translations for you, check if you 
are in Reviewing mode - if so, click on the Drafting button and all should then 
work as you expect.</p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Selecting"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Selecting</b></font></p>
<p>There are three ways to select. Selections always are made in the source 
text, for each of the three selection methods.</p>
<p><font size="3"><u>Way 1: Selecting forwards or backwards starting from the 
Phrase Box, using the ALT key.</u></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold down the ALT key and press the right arrow key – to select forwards.
  <br>
  For a backwards selection, hold down ALT and press the left arrow key instead.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above step as many times as necessary until you have the 
  required selection. </li>
  <li>If you encounter a place where there is punctuation (except comma), Adapt 
  It will prevent you from selecting further – but you can select further by 
  clicking the following button
  <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image2.gif" width="24" height="23"> 
  so that it changes to
  <img src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image3.gif" border="0" width="24" height="23"> 
  , and then you will be able to select further.</li>
  <li>If you select too many source words, keep holding down the ALT key while 
  you press the arrow key for the opposite direction – this will shorten your 
  selection.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3"><u>Way 2: Selecting forwards or backwards anywhere, by 
extending the selection using the SHIFT key. This method does not require the 
phrase box to be located within the selection or at its start or end.</u></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click once on the source word (or source phrase) where you want your 
  selection to start.</li>
  <li>Hold down the SHIFT key and click once on the source word (or source 
  phrase) where you want the selection to end.</li>
  <li>If there is punctuation (except comma) between those two points, Adapt It 
  will prevent the full selection from happening – but you can make it happen by 
  clicking the following button
  <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image2.gif" width="24" height="23"> 
  so that it changes to
  <img border="0" src="Images/Adapt%20It%20Quick%20Start/Image3.gif" width="24" height="23"> 
  , and then you can click at the end while holding down the SHIFT key and the 
  selection you want will appear.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3"><u>Way 3: Selecting forwards or backwards anywhere by clicking 
and dragging.</u></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Click </font>on the source word (or source phrase) where 
  you want your selection to start and keep holding down the mouse button</li>
  <li>While you hold the mouse button down, drag the mouse to the last source 
  word (or phrase) that you want to be in your selection. You don't have to make 
  the cursor touch all of the words you want selected, just touch the last one.</li>
  <li>If there is punctuation (except comma) between those two points, Adapt It 
  will prevent the full selection from happening – but you can make it happen by 
  holding down the CTRL key while you move the mouse a very small distance, and 
  then the selection you want will appear.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><a name="Merging_guick_way"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Merging 
(or combining) two or more source words (maximum of 10) – the quick way</b></font></p>
<p>This is the easiest method, because your hands do not need to leave the 
keyboard.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold down the <b>ALT</b> key while pressing the <b>right arrow</b> key – 
  this selects the first two words </li>
  <li>If you want to selection to include more than two words, keep holding down 
  the <b>ALT</b> key while you press the <b>right arrow</b> key again. Keep 
  doing that until the selection contains all the words you want to merge into a 
  phrase. If you select too many, hold down <b>ALT</b> while you press the <b>
  left arrow</b> key as often as you need. </li>
  <li>Do one of these things:<br>
  a) keep holding down the <b>ALT</b> key while you press the <b>ENTER</b> key, 
  then type the translation, or<br>
  b) just <b>start typing the translation</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: other possibilities are the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>You can merge source words to the left of the active location by holding 
  down the <b>ALT</b> key while pressing the <b>left arrow</b> button; then use
  <b>ALT+ENTER</b>, or just start typing, to make the merge happen. <br>
  (The existing translations of those source words will also be combined to form 
  a target text phrase, and will be shown in the phrase box for you to edit, 
  remove, or add to them.)</li>
  <li>You can type a long translation in the phrase box first, and then use the
  <b>ALT+Right Arrow</b> key combination to select all the appropriate source 
  text words, and then <b>ALT+ENTER</b> to merge them. <br>
  Your original typing will appear in the phrase box after the merge is done - 
  but with some extra source words at the end which you'll need to delete.</li>
  <li>You can add extra source words to an existing merge using the technique 
  explained in b).</li>
  <li>You can merge source words not at the active location, using the more 
  general method described next.</li>
</ol>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Merging_general_way"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Merging 
(or combining) two or more source words (maximum of 10) – the general way</b></font></p>
<p>The phrase box can be anywhere before you do these steps. When you have 
finished, the phrase box will be located at the new source phrase which has just 
been constructed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select</b> the source text word where you want the merge to start by <b>
  clicking</b> on it. </li>
  <li>Hold down the <b>SHIFT</b> key while you <b>click</b> at the source text 
  word where you want the merge to end. <br>
  All the words between those two locations will become selected. </li>

<p>You use a placeholder when you want to insert some extra target text, but

<ul>
  <li>Indicate where you want the placeholder inserted. The insertion takes 
  place<u> immediately preceding</u> some defined location; or if you hold down 
  the CTRL key when you click the button it will take place <u>immediately 
  following</u> that location.<br>
  You can define the location by using one of the following two methods:<br>
  a) <b>Select</b> a source word or phrase by <b>clicking</b> on it, or<br>
  b) <b>Click</b> under the appropriate source word or phrase (but don't bother 
  if the phrase box is already there) </li>

  <li>If you inserted a placeholder at a place where there is punctuation, Adapt 
  It will not know whether you want the placeholder to be considered as the end 
  of the words which precede it, or as the start of the words which follow it. 
  Therefore, Adapt It will put up a message box to ask you which of those two 
  options is correct. When you click either the <b>Yes</b>, or <b>No</b> button,

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0000FF">
<a name="Entering or leaving glossing mode">Entering or leaving glossing mode</a></font></h3>
<p>You can enter or leave glossing mode at any time, and as often as you want. 
The &quot;glosses&quot; can be anything you like, such as linguistic glosses, or the 
meaning of the source text expressed in some other language than the target 
text's language. Punctuation DOES get saved within the glossing knowledge base - 
if you don't want this to happen there is a command in the Advanced menu that 
will make Adapt It strip off any punctuation before the store operation is done. 
Adapt It uses the target text punctuation characters for use with the glossing 
language.<br>
<br>
If you are in adapting mode and you want to enter glossing mode, do the 
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <b>Advanced</b> menu click <b>Allow Glossing</b>. A <b>glossing </b>
  checkbox will appear at the end of the toolbar. The application can now show 
  glosses but is still in adapting mode when the glossing checkbox remains 
  unticked.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>glossing</b> checkbox to turn glossing mode on. When the 
  checkbox is ticked, everything you type will be interpreted as a gloss, and 
  will be stored in the glossing knowledge base. When in glossing mode, you 
  cannot do mergers or retranslations, and you cannot insert placeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to leave glossing mode to reenter adapting mode, do one of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>glossing</b> checkbox again, to remove the tick. Adapting 
  mode recommences immediately, but glosses can still be seen, though they 
  cannot be edited. Or...</li>
  <li>In the <b>Advanced</b> menu click <b>Allow Glossing</b> again, to remove 
  the tick. Adapting mode will recommence immediately, the <b>glossing</b> 
  checkbox will disappear, and glosses will not be visible - however the 
  glossing knowledge base remains and is ready for use if you later turn 
  glossing back on. The display will revert to two lines.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><a name="Automatic capitalization">
Automatic capitalization</a></font></b></p>
<p>In automatic capitalization mode the application will allow you to type a 
word or phrase beginning with a lower case letter, and if the source text begins 
with a capital letter at that location then the first letter you type will be 
changed automatically to the appropriate capital letter. In this mode knowledge 
base entries are stored in lower case only. This mode can be turned off or on at 
any time, and as often as desired. The setting you currently have in effect when 
the project is closed will be retained in the project's configuration file. 
Automatic capitalization will work only if the source text's language 
distinguishes between upper and lower case. Adapt It only looks at the first 
character; if you need a capital letter in a position which is not first in the 
word or phrase you type, you must type that capital letter explicitly.</p>
<p>To set up automatic capitalization do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> menu click the <b>Automatic Capitalization...</b> 
  command. </li>
  <li>A <b>message box</b> will ask you if the source language distinguishes 
  upper and lower case letters. You must click the <b>Yes</b> button for 
  automatic capitalization mode to begin. If the source language does not 
  distinguish between upper and lower case, there is no point trying to turn 
  this mode on, so just click the <b>No</b> button. Adapt It will show you the
  <b>Lower To Upper Case Equivalences</b> dialog for you to set up the 
  correspondences between lower and upper case. Fill out the lists.&nbsp; A <b>
  Set Latin Equivalences</b> button will fill the list with Latin equivalences 
  (which is what English uses), otherwise type in what you need manually. You 
  won't see this dialog if the lists already have equivalences defined.</li>
  <li>If necessary, on the <b>Edit</b> menu click the <b>Lower To Upper Case 
  Equivalences</b> command. In the dialog which comes up make sure the lists for 
  the lower and upper case letter pairs are filled out, for both the <b>source 
  text</b> and the <b>target text</b>. (If you are doing glossing and you have 
  chosen to use the navigation text's font for the glossing, specify the case 
  pairs for the navigation text's language as well in the third list.) If the 
  required correspondences are the same or similar to English ones, buttons can 
  help you fill the lists quickly. If you want some letters not automatically 
  capitalized, leave them out of the appropriate list.</li>

the display from two lines to 3 lines, or 4 lines; or back again to 2 lines.</b></font></p>
<p>If you use the <b>Find</b> or <b>Replace</b> commands, Adapt It will 
automatically switch the view of the document so that instead of seeing a source 
text line with a target text line underneath it, you will see <u>two source text 
lines</u> and under them <u>two target text lines</u>. The top source text line 
will contain punctuation; the second source text line will have the punctuation 
removed. The first target text line will have no punctuation, and the bottom 
line will have punctuation shown.</p>
<p>This behaviour will be changed in a future version. Only two lines are really 
needed, so one day we will get rid of the three or four line display options.</p>
<p>Adapt It works the same way, whether you are seeing two lines, or more than 
two. There are some slight differences however: for example, in the four-line 
display you can do long selections in the top source text line without having to 
worry about hitting boundaries where there is punctuation. You can work with 3 
lines if you wish: two source lines and one target line; or one source line and 
two target lines. Any combination is legal and safe.</p>
<p>Most people will want to work with just one source line and one target line. 
This is the default display mode – it is what you see when you first start 
working with the application. </p>
<p><br>
There are two buttons which allow you to change how many lines are shown: </p>

<p>Each click on these buttons reverses the setting. You can also change these

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Correcting_wrong_translations"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Correcting 
a wrong translation used many times already</b></font></p>
<p>Sometime you may realize that a translation for a certain source word, or a 
certain source phrase, is not correct and you want to fix it everywhere it 
occurs in all the document files. Or it might be correct in some places, but 
incorrect in other places. Here is how to &quot;split&quot; an adaptation, to fix a wrong 
adaptation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Tools</b> menu </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Knowledge Base Editor…</b> command </li>
  <li><b>Click</b> whichever <b>tab</b> has the source word or source phrase 
  with the wrong translation </li>
  <li>In the left list box, scroll till you find the source word or phrase, or 
  start typing it in the text box at the bottom left; when you see it, <b>select</b> 
  it. (The right list box will then show all the translations, including the one 
  which is not correct.) </li>
  <li><b>Click the incorrect translation</b> to select it. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Remove</b> button, to remove it from the knowledge base. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button, to close the window and cause the knowledge 
  base to be updated on the disk. (You have deliberately produced an 
  inconsistency between the knowledge base and the adaptations within the 
  documents. Now you can exploit this fact.)</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> menu. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Consistency Check…</b> command. Choose whether you want to do 
  the check in just the current document (not recommended), or in this and other 
  documents (highly recommended), then click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
  <li>If you clicked the &quot;this and others&quot; option, in the dialog which appears 
  don't move any files to the right hand side if you want to make all your 
  documents consistent with the changes you are wanting to put into effect; just 
  immediately click the <b>OK</b> button. <br>
  (Adapt It will now check every document you have created. The removed 
  translation will no longer be found in the knowledge base, only in the 
  documents, which is an inconsistency. So every instance of that inconsistency 
  will now be found, one after another in all the chosen documents.)</li>
  <li>Every time the inconsistency is found, Adapt It will show a dialog which 
  allows you to <b>fix the inconsistency</b>; and the main window will show you 
  where the inconsistency occurs.<br>
  If you want to fix the inconsistency the same way every time, click the 
  checkbox with the label:<br>
  <b>Auto-fix later instances the same way</b> then you will not be asked to fix 
  later instances of the same error, instead Adapt It will fix them for you 
  automatically.<br>
  If you want to &quot;split&quot; an adaptation into two or more different adaptations, 
  then each time you see the inconsistency, you would either accept the old 
  adaptation, or double-click a different one in the list, or type a new one if 
  there was no suitable one in the list. You would NOT use the <b>Auto-fix later 
  instances the same way</b> if you are splitting an adaptation, instead you 
  have to go do each change manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Recover_from_corrupt_KB"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>How 
to recover from a corrupted knowledge base.</b></font></p>
<p>If for some reason your knowledge base has become corrupted, you can recover 
quickly and easily. Knowledge base corruption is not a problem that Adapt It 
has, however, hard drives are not totally reliable and a sector might go bad, 
resulting in a corrupted KB file. Adapt It can recreate the knowledge base. Do 
the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get Adapt It running. </li>
  <li><b>Close</b> any open document, but <u>leave the project with the 
  corrupted knowledge base open</u>. <br>
  (An easy way to do this is to relaunch the application, and in the Startup 
  Wizard open the project, and then cancel the Startup Wizard when you reach the 
  Documents page.) </li>
  <li>Click the <b>File</b> menu </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Restore Knowledge Base…</b> command </li>
  <li>A message box will come up telling you about what you are about to do, and 
  giving you a chance to back out. Don't back out, unless you don't want to 
  restore the knowledge base. </li>
  <li>Another message box will come up giving you the chance to restore some 
  special settings. This is for advanced users only. Probably it is easiest if 
  you click the <b>No</b> button, it is not very likely that you will have any 
  of those settings in your knowledge base anyway. (See the Adapt It Basics 
  documentation for a more detailed explanation.) </li>
  <li>Adapt It will show you a dialog which lists all your document files. You 
  should leave all of them in the left hand side list box for best results. <br>
  (Any that you are certain contain no useful adaptations, you can use the top 
  button in the dialog to move those files to the right hand side. Those files 
  won't be used in the restoration process.) </li>
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button when you are ready for the restoration to 
  begin.<br>
  (Adapt It will do the restoration, create a new knowledge base, save it to 
  disk, install it also in memory, and then you will be ready to continue 
  working on documents.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <b>restore</b> the knowledge base in the above manner<b> even if it 
is not corrupted</b>.<br>
<br>
For instance, if your knowledge base contains rubbish adaptations from when you 
were just playing with the program for the first time and making document files 
which have no permanent value, mixed together with good adaptations from doing 
real work on scripture files, then you can do a restoration to get rid of the 
rubbish data. Just move the files with the rubbish translations to the right 
hand list box in the second-last step. When finished, your new knowledge base 
will contain only the good translations that you want to keep permanently.</p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><a name="Handling_punctuation_properly"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Handling 
punctuation properly</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Adapt It will copy the source text punctuation over to the 
translation automatically</font><font size="4">, </font><font size="3">so you 
normally do not need to type punctuation. Just let Adapt It insert it for you.</font></p>
<p>Sometimes this automatic punctuation does not give you the results you want.
<br>
Here are the possibilities:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The location for the punctuation is correct, but you want a different kind 
  of punctuation there; or</li>
  <li>Adapt It is copying punctuation, but you don't want any at that point in 
  the translation; or</li>
  <li>Adapt It is copying punctuation, some of it is correct, and some of it is 
  not what you want; or</li>
  <li>the target language uses a kind of punctuation which is different than in 
  the source language, so the copying of source text punctuation gives the wrong 
  result. <br>
  (Note: source text punctuation is not actually &quot;copied&quot;, but rather Adapt It 
  looks at the table of punctuation correspondences you set up with the <b>
  Source and Target Punctuation Correspondences</b> dialog and for each source 
  punctuation character it determines what the appropriate target text 
  punctuation character should be. If there is nothing listed for that source 
  punctuation character, nothing is transferred to the target text.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the ways you can handle these problems:</p>
<p>For problem (a):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where the copied punctuation would appear, in the phrase box type the 
  punctuation you want to occur at that part of the text. <br>
  (Your typed punctuation will be used instead, and Adapt It will not insert the 
  corresponding target punctuation.) </li>
</ul>
<p>For problem (b):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the Edit menu's Edit Source Text command, and in the dialog edit out 
  the punctuation from the source text. (This is not an ideal solution, but it 
  may suffice if source text changes don't matter. Or you can use the 
  alternative but longer method below.) <br>
  (The punctuation in the source text at the active location is removed so Adapt 
  It will not longer try to insert any punctuation into the target text at that 
  location. NOTE: if you later want to Export the source text, DO NOT use this 
  method, instead use the following method.)</li>
  <li>Alternatively, from the Edit menu, click the Edit Punctuation 
  Correspondences command. In the dialog remove the target text punctuation 
  which corresponds to the source text punctuation you don't want to be copied 
  at this location. Close the dialog. Then hit ENTER to move the phrase box to 
  the next location. Then again open the Edit Punctuation Correspondences 
  command and put back the target punctuation character(s) you removed above - 
  DON'T FORGET to do this step! Close the dialog and continue working. (This 
  method leaves the source text unchanged, and so any subsequent export of the 
  source text will produce correctly punctuated source text data.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For problem (c)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use one of the preceding alternatives, preferably the second - except you 
  may need to temporarily delete more than one target punctuation character from 
  the dialog. Remember to replace them after you have moved the phrase box on to 
  the next location.</li>
</ul>
<p>For problem (d)</p>
<ul>
  <li>You don't have a needed punctuation correspondence set up yet. Fix it by 
  opening the <b>Edit Punctuation Correspondences</b> dialog and type the needed 
  correspondence into the left pair of columns. Note, in the source list each 
  unique punctuation character may only appear ONCE. In the target list you can 
  have more than one instance of the same punctuation character. Then close the 
  dialog and continue with your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do choose to use the Edit menu's &quot;Edit Source Text&quot; command you can 
also get access to the source text's standard format markers via a child dialog 
accessible from the first dialog put up by this command. However, editing the 
source text is not something you should do without careful consideration 
beforehand, and careful manual text management - such as archiving of the 
original source text before any editing is done on a copy of it. It would be 
easy to lose track of what constitutes the true source text if you are not 
careful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Saving_documents_automatically"></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Saving

<p>You can save manually at any time by going to the <b>File</b> menu and 
clicking the <b>Save</b> command; or by using the keyboard shortcut <b>CTRL+S</b>.</p>
<p>If you don't want to be bothered by having to occasionally save your work, do 
the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> menu. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Preferences</b>… command. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Auto-Saving</b> tab. </li>
  <li>Click to <b>turn OFF</b> the top <b>checkbox</b>. (Auto-saving is now 
  enabled.) </li>
  <li><b>Choose</b> the auto-saving method you prefer. <br>
  a) Adapt It can save your document and knowledge base <b>after a certain time 
  has elapsed</b>; or <br>
  b) it can save them <b>after the phrase box has moved to a new location a 
  certain number of times</b>. <br>
  (If you are adapting quickly, a time setting - such as every two minutes will 
  protect your work best. <br>
  If you are working slowly, or are just learning to use the program, saving 
  every few dozen moves might be a better choice. <br>
  You can change these settings at any time, or turn them off again.) </li>
  <li>(Optional step) Choose a setting for how often the knowledge base should 
  be saved. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to exit the Preferences dialog.</li>

<p>The way your document is displayed on the screen is understood only by Adapt 
It. If you want other computer programs to be able to use your translated text, 
it first has to be exported. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>File</b> menu. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Export Translation Text…</b> command. A dialog will open and 
  give you the choice between exporting the text as standard format marked text, 
  or as a rich text format (RTF) document with the standard format markers 
  changed to publication standard styles according to the Scripture Template. 
  Choose the option which suits your purpose. If you want to use the exported 
  data for a backtranslation project, or for display in Paratext, then choose 
  the standard format option. If you want to print the translation in a nice 
  readable publication-standard format, use the RTF option. Then a standard 
  Windows <b>file dialog</b> will open, with a suggested output filename (your 
  document's name, or if you want the RTF option, it will have .rtf appended to 
  the name), and a destination folder and disk drive. </li>
  <li>Use the <b>file dialog</b> to change the filename if you wish, and the 
  folder where you want the file saved to if the suggested location is not 
  suitable. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button. <br>
  Adapt It will then create the file and fill it with the translated text. You 
  don't have to have the translation of the whole document finished before you 
  use the Export Translation Text… command. If it is not finished, then some of 
  the verses will just not have any text in them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you export the document, you will end up with a separate file containing 
only the target language translated text, with all the SIL standard format 
markers replaced in their correct positions, or with an rtf file you can then 
read into any word processor and print from there. </p>
<p>Adapt It may put up a dialog during the export process if it needs your help 
to know where to replace some of the markers. This will happen only you merged 
source words across the location where a marker occurred, or if a marker lies 
within a retranslation.</p>
<p>A similar command, <strong>Export Source Text</strong>, will allow you to 
export only the source text, with standard format markers automatically 
replaced, or as RTF. You would normally only use this command if you had earlier 
used the <strong>Edit Source Text</strong> command to change the source text in 
some way.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;You would probably only want to export the

either as a plain text file with standard format markers automatically replaced; 
or as an RTF (Rich Text Format) document in which the replaced standard format

<font face="Arial" color="#000080" size="2">apply to Adapt It nor to Adapt It 
Unicode! They apply only to the additional &quot;stand-alone&quot; Consistent Changes 
applications included in the installer for Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode for your 
convenience. None of the comments below have any bearing on using Adapt It or 
Adapt It Unicode. If you want to build and test consistent changes tables 
separately from using such tables within Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode, then this 
section will help you to do so - that's the only reason this information is 
here. By &quot;stand-alone&quot; we mean that you can run these cc applications without 
having to run Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode installers as 
from version 2.3.0 also include version 8 (dated October 2002) of the Consistent 
Changes application as a stand-alone executable. The filename is CCW32.exe and 
it will be found in your Program Files\Adapt It\&nbsp; folder, and/or in your 
Program Files\Adapt It Unicode\&nbsp; folder - this version of CC is compliant 
with both ASCII and ANSI encodings and also the UTF-8 encoding. Full 
documentation for CCW32 will be found, also in the same location, in a CC 
Documentation folder. The folder includes additional documentation for a 
standalone CC debugger application called CCDbg32.exe. Unfortunately this 
debugger application is <b><font color="#FF0000">not</font></b> included with 
the installation because the installer for Adapt It becomes too large. (However, 
you can request the debugger be sent by email from the author - as a compressed 
executable it is 201 KB in size.) Note, these applications both use the CC32.DLL 
file - the same .DLL file which Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode use. So if you 
move one or both of these cc applications to another folder and want to run them 
from that other folder, be sure to <b><font color="#FF0000">copy</font></b> (not 
move, and not cut and paste) the CC32.DLL file to that folder also.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you run CCW32, you will see the following 
window which is divided into 5 sections, the first is a command history - it is 
not important, the next sections allow you to specify a working directory, what 
input data you want processed, what cc table is to be used for the processing, 
and what file the output is to be saved in.</font></p>
<p>You should put the cc table file you wish to use in the Working Directory - 
this should be the same directory as contains the CCW32 application itself. The 
input and output files can be from and to any folder. Use the top Browse button 
to make the folder containing CCW32 the working directory.</p>
<p>In the Input file section, type the name of the input (plain text) file which 
is to be processed if it is located in the working directory, or use the Browse 
button to locate it.</p>
<p>In the Changes file section, type the name of the consistent changes table 
file which is to be used - it must have an .cct filename extension to be 
recognised as a changes file.</p>
<p>In the Output file section, type the name of the wanted output file - it will 
be output to the working directory, but if you want it to be sent to a different 
folder then use the Browse button to tell the application which folder to put it 
in. If the results are not as you expect and you need to edit the table and try 
again, fill out the sections as before, and click the &quot;Overwrite existing 
output&quot; checkbox.</p>
<p>Click the Process button to cause cc processing to commence.</p>
<p align="center">________________</p>
<p>Note: in the installation two .cct tables are provided for your convenience. 
Both have been tested.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A table called &quot;reverse_lx_ge.cct&quot;. This table will do a &quot;reversal&quot; of the 
  file produced by Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode when you click the &quot;Export 
  Knowledge Base&quot; command. It takes the \lx and \ge fields, changes their order 
  and renames the markers so that in the output file the old \lx fields are now 
  \ge fields, and the old \ge fields are now \lx fields. <br>
  <br>
  This table would be useful if you have an existing adaptation project in which 
  you have translated text from language A to language B; and for some reason 
  you want to set up another language project to translate text from language B 
  back to language A. To do this type of job it would be helpful to be able to 
  populate the knowledge base for the B to A adaptations project with all the 
  necessary adaptations data before starting to adapt any documents. This table 
  will allow you to do that. Proceed as follows:<br>
  <br>
  Use the table in CCW32, and for the input use the file you get from exporting 
  the KB from the A to B adaptations project. Launch Adapt It (or Adapt It 
  Unicode), and then the output of the preceding sentence's process can then be 
  loaded into the KB of the B to A adaptations project by using the &quot;Import to 
  Knowledge Base&quot; command. Then you are ready to begin adapting B text back to 
  language A at full speed and with minimal typing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A table called &quot;table series as one.cct&quot;. Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode are 
  designed to optionally handle up to four tables in series - the output from 
  each becoming the input to the next. Sometimes it might be necessary to do an 
  adaptation with more than four tables in series. This &quot;table series as one.cct&quot; 
  table allows you to take the rule contents of three tables and paste them into 
  the appropriate places in this one table. In this way adaptation could be done 
  with up to twelve sub-tables processed in sequence (four tables, each with 
  three sub-tables). The contents of this table could be easily modified to make 
  the table handle more than three sub-tables - so in effect any number of cc 
  tables can be processed in sequence using this table in suitably modified 
  form. The table contains comments which tell you where to paste your sub-table 
  rules.</li>

  <li>Either these are advanced topics, or they are not essential for successful 
  use of the application for beginners, and can be left till later on. For 
  details of anything not covered here, see the Adapt It Basics documentation 
  file. Note: the adaptation engine in Adapt It is not based on SIL's consistent 
  changes application. Consistent changes is only an option; it does not have to 
  be used to do adaptation work successfully; but in the hands of someone who 
  knows how to make use of consistent changes it can be a powerful extra tool to 
  help automate the translation process - especially if there are affixes which 
  change in a regular way or sound changes which result in spelling differences 
  of a regular kind. See the full reference documentation for more details.</li>
