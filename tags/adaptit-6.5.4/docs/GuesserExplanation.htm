<h2 align="center">Making Suffix and Prefix Lists For The Guesser</h2>
<p>Affixes are of two main types: <strong>prefixes</strong> or <strong>suffixes</strong>. Affixes are usually short, and they have meaning.
<br>Prefixes occur at or near the start of a word; suffixes at or near the end of a word.
<br>Use the dialog to <strong>Add</strong>, <strong>Update</strong> (edit), <strong>Insert</strong>, or <strong>Delete</strong> (remove), affix pairs - either to the prefixes list, or to the suffixes list.</p>
<p>Choose which list to work with by clicking <strong>Prefixes List</strong>, or <strong>Suffixes List</strong>.
<br>(If the source and target languages do not use prefixes, just leave the Prefixes List empty.)</p>
<p>Each list that has contents will display <strong>two columns</strong> of affixes. Each line contains an <strong>affix pair</strong>.
<br>For each affix pair: the first affix is from the source language, and the second is the affix which has the <strong>same meaning</strong> in the target language.
<br>If the source language has a certain affix, but the target language lacks it, enter the source language's affix, but leave the target language's text box empty.
<br>If the target language has a certain affix, but the source language lacks it, do not bother trying to enter the target language affix into the list, because that line of the table would be ignored.
<p>Type the affixes (that is, suffixes or prefixes depending on which list you are working in) into the two text boxes at the right of the dialog. (Do not type hyphens.) The left hand box is for a source language affix. The right hand box is where you type the equivalent affix from the target language.
<br>If you select a line in the list, that line's contents will appear in the text boxes and you can then edit either affix, or both.</p>
<p>Buttons below the text boxes allow you to control what is done. You can:
<br>Add a new affix pair at the end of the list.
<br>Insert the affix pair which is in the text boxes into the list; it will be put immediately preceding the currently selected line.
<br>Delete an affix pair. Or,
<br>Update a pair, meaning that your editing changes done in the two text boxes will get moved into the selected line in the list.</p>
<p> The lists are not ordered, so you can keep similar kinds of affixes grouped together in your chosen part of the table.
<br><strong>The more valid affix pairings you supply, the more accurate the Guesser will be when it suggests a translation for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helpful Hints</strong></p>
<p>1.  The Guesser does not really understand what affixes are. It just matches recurring groups of letters. So the groups of letters you include in the lists can contain more letters than what actually occur in affixes - the Guesser will not know and it will not care. In particular, it sometimes helps if some of the affixes you type include a letter from the spelling of the root of the word.
<br>2.  When the Guesser is matching source text to target text affix guesses, if there are longer and shorter matchups possible, it will always prefer the longer one over the shorter one. Combing this fact with 1. above, it is possible to enter pairs that handle spelling changes at affix boundaries (linguists call this language behavior "morphophonemic changes")
<br>3.  Enter into the list only affix spellings that actually occur.
<br>4.  If the spelling of an affixes changes depending on what follows it, enter all the possible combinations as a series of pairs. (It may help to include the first letter of the root when typing a prefix, or the last letter of the root when typing a suffix, if such affixes can occur next to the root and spellings of the root or affix can change at that boundary. Often this means you need to type a lot of pairs which differ from each other only slightly.)
<br>5.  Sometimes, when two (or more) affixes occur together, as a combination they have a spelling which is unexpected, or "irregular". In this circumstance, type into the Guesser list each such pair of irregular spellings - the irregular affix combination from the source langauge followed by the matching affix combination from the target language. 
<br>6.  Do not expect the Guesser to do miracles. Even though you supply lots of pairs, there will always be circumstances in the texts being adapted which do not result in giving you an accurate prediction. These you will need to correct manually in the phrasebox when you do your adapting work.</p>
