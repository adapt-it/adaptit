<h2>Adapt It projects, books, and documents overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It organizes work at three levels-- projects, books, and documents.</p>
<h3>Adapt It projects</h3>
<p class="BodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText">A project is a collection of all the files necessary in the adaptation process of translating a set of texts in a source language into target language texts. Adapt It stores all projects in the Adapt It Work or the Adapt It Unicode Work folder. Each project has its own projects in a computer subfolder named usingfor the source and target language names. The project subfoldere project containsincludes both documents and a knowledge bases for the languagesproject. The project folder may also containinclude sub folders to hold documents by book. See <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/Folders/The_Adapt_It_Folder_Organization.htm">.</a></p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It projects are stored in the Adapt It Work folder as a subfolder. Each project subfolder has a unique name which uses the names of the source and target language. The project subfolder contains a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/Config_files/Project_Configuration_file.htm">project configuration file</a>, an <a href="../../Knowledge_Base/Adaptation_knowledge_base.htm">adaptation knowledge base</a>, and a subfolder called Adaptations. If you are using <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Glossing/Glossing.htm">glossing</a>, the project folder also includes a <a href="../../Knowledge_Base/Glossing_knowledge_base.htm">glossing knowledge base</a>. The Adaptations subfolder contains the document files directly or within Book subfolders.</p>
<h3>Adapt It books</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The book structure is optional and consists of a series of subfolders within a project. Book folders are stored in the Adaptation folder of the project. Each book folder can contain one or more Adapt It documents.</p>
<p class="BodyText">A book folder represents a logical unit of the total project. For example, when translating the Bible, each Adapt It book folder contains documents related to a specific book of the Bible.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you decided to use <a href="Book_folders_mode.htm">Book folders mode</a>, Adapt It can automatically build the subfolders for Bible books. However, the book structure can be used for other collections of documents. In order to use the book structure with non-biblical books, you will have to modify one of the configuration files. <a href="../../Adapt_It_Concepts/Contact_the_authors.htm">Contact the authors</a> for information on how to do this.</p>
<h3>Adapt It documents</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Documents are where the actual work of adaptation takes place. A document contains, at a minimum, the source text and the target text to the extent it has been adapted. The document can also contain other adaptation helps such as: <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Glossing/Glossing_overview.htm">gloss text</a>, <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Back_Translation/Back_translation_overview.htm">back translations</a>, <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Free_Translation/Free_translation_overview.htm">free translations</a>, and <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Notes/Adapt_It_Notes_overview.htm">notes</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It documents are stored in the Adaptations subfolder of the project. If you are using Book folders mode, the documents are stored in the appropriate book folder.</p>
