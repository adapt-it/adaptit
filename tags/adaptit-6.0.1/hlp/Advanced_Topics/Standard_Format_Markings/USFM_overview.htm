<h2>USFM Overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">USFM stands for <span class="Strong">U</span>nified <span class="Strong">S</span>tandard <span class="Strong">F</span>ormat <span class="Strong">M</span>arkers. Although Adapt It can input plain text files for adaptation, Adapt It normally uses text files in which each part of the text is marked with a standard format marker (SFM). The SFM &quot;marks&quot; the function of that particular part of the text. That is the SFM tells what type of information follows such as a verse, chapter, line of poetry, or a heading, for example. All SFMs begin with a backslash character (\).</p>
<p class="BodyText">Different inventories or sets of SFMs have been in use over the years. One widely used SFM set was formally adopted by the PNG branch of SIL in 1998. We refer to that SFM set as the &quot;PNG set.&quot; More recently, SIL and the United Bible Societies adopted the Unified Standard Format Markers (USFM) which is a much larger set of standard format markers. We refer to this newer set as the &quot;USFM set.&quot; Adapt It can input files for adaptation and recognize plain text files marked with either the older PNG set or the newer USFM set.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The SFM set that a document uses can be indicated by means of the <span class="UserInterface">USFM</span> page which is displayed when you first create an Adapt It project. The USFM page is also available on the <span class="UserInterface">USFM</span> tab of the <span class="UserInterface">Preferences</span> dialog which is accessible from the <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span> menu whenever a document is open. To find out which SFM set is currently in use, or to change the SFM set see the <a href="Set_USFM_preferences.htm">Set USFM Preferences</a> procedure.</p>

<p class="BodyText">SFM markers are used for many purposes, not just types of text. They can also be used for formatting purposes such as controlling bold, italics, and indentation for when the document is to be published. Adapt It generally hides the actual markers. In some cases, as in the <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/UI_Structure/Navigation_text.htm">Navigation text</a> of the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>, Adapt It shows the meaning of the marker. For example, Adapt It displays chapter and verse information.</p>
