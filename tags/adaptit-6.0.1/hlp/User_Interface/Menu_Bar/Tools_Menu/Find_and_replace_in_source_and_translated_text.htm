<h2>Find and replace in source and translated text</h2>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../../Images/find_and_replace_dialog_both.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">By default, the dialog assumes you want to search in the translation text. To use both source and translated text, select the <span class="UserInterface">Both Source Text and Translated Text</span> option as shown above.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You can type your search text into the upper text boxes. The search texts do not have to be entire words, but each can be any part of a word.</p>
<p class="BodyText">This find and replace mode works in what is called an "And" relationship. This means that Adapt It has to find <span class="Emphasis">both</span> the source text entry and the translation text entry in the same <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span> to consider the result a match. If Adapt It finds the source text with some other translation, it moves on to try to find the combination somewhere else.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The search texts do not have to be entire words but can also be parts of words. Adapt It highlights the entire word in yellow, even though the matched text is a fragment of the word.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The default mode of search is case-sensitive meaning that that Adapt It treats "A" as a different character than "a". You can have Adapt It ignore the differences by checking the <span class="UserInterface">Ignore Case</span> <img src="../../../Images/ignore_case.GIF"> check box.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It assumes you want to search the lines without punctuation. If you wish to search the line with punctuation, check the <span class="UserInterface">Search in lines which retain punctuation</span> <img src="../../../Images/search_in_punct_line.GIF">check box. Adapt It then searches the line with punctuation. This feature is useful if you need to find a particular punctuation mark.</p>
<p class="BodyText">At times you may want to find a particular combination of words phrase, but you have not <a href="../../../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Phrase_icons/Make_a_phrase_using_the_make_phrase_icon.htm">made them into a phrase</a>. In this case, you need to have Adapt It, search for the words using multiple piles, not just one. To do this, check the <span class="UserInterface">Allow the search to occur in text spanning multiple piles</span> <img src="../../../Images/search_span.GIF"> check box. This feature may be useful if you do want to convert the word combination into a phrase.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When you have determined what you are searching for you can enter the replacement text into the <span class="UserInterface">Replacement Text:</span> text box. Then you can click one of the command buttons on the right hand side:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Find Next</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option searches the document to find the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Within Translation:</span> text box and positions the active location at the pile containing the match. Nothing is replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Replace</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option replaces the matched text with the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Replacement Text:</span> text box. You may have to use the <span class="UserInterface">Find Next</span> option to position the active location at the matched text.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If your match finds part of a word, Adapt It replaces only the word fragment with the replacement text, the remainder of the word remains as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Replace All</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option searches through the entire document starting at the active location replacing every occurrence of the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Translation:</span> text box with the replacement text. The starting active location does not have to be at a match.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Use this option carefully; you can easily make changes that you do not want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Cancel</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option closes the dialog without making doing any additional changes. It does not undo any changes that you have already made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img src="../../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It cannot replace source text. See <a href="../Edit_Menu/Edit_Source_text.htm">Edit source text</a> to make changes if they are necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The translation text and source text do not have to be equivalent. That is an entire word could be in the <span class="UserInterface">Source Text:</span> text box while the <span class="UserInterface">Within Translation:</span> text box could a word fragment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
