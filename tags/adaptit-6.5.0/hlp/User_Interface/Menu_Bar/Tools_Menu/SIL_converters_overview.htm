<h2>SIL Converters overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">SIL Converters are a set of tools which, in Adapt It, permit conversions to be performed on the source text data before it is displayed for editing in the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. You can find out how to use SIL Converters in a document called SIL Converters in AdaptIt.doc. This document is contained in both the Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode subfolders of the Program Files folder.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To use SIL Converters, you must download and install the software from the following website--<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/EncCnvtrs">http://scripts.sil.org/EncCnvtrs</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">There are a number of converters available; each converter deals with the conversion from one encoding to another. For example, one converter handles the conversion of Cyrillic characters to Latin characters. You can choose which converter meets your translation needs.</p>
<p class="BodyText">SIL Converters work cooperatively with the normal lookup of the knowledge base and automatic insertion feature. Even when a converter is active, if the lookup finds a suitable translation in the knowledge base, it is copied to the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. If the lookup cannot find a translation or detects the &lt;Not In KB&gt; marker, processing is turned over to the converter. The converter uses the source text word or phrase and makes a conversion. The converter places the results into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. The user can inspect and edit the result if necessary. Once the user has accepted the adaptation, a &lt;Not In KB&gt; marker is placed in the knowledge base.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">SIL Converters are available for use with Adapt It as an optional feature, but are not required for normal adapting purposes. They are useful for special processing needs. Only advanced users who understand these types of conversions should attempt to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">When using SIL Converters, establish a dedicated project. The special processing required is not compatible with the normal adaptation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You cannot run both SIL Converters and <a href="../../../Advanced_Topics/Consistent_Changes/Consistent_changes_overview.htm">Consistent Changes</a> at the same time. If both applications are selected, Consistent Changes runs but SIL Converters does not.</p>

</ul>
