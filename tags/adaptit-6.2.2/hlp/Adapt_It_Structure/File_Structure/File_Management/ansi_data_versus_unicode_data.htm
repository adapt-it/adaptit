<h2>ANSI data versus Unicode data</h2>
<p class="BodyText">There are a number of <span class="DefinedWord">data formats</span> used by computers. The American National Standards Institute (<span class="DefinedWord">ANSI</span>) has defined a format for characters using one <span class="DefinedWord">byte</span> of data for each 
character. This format is useful for European or Latin-based languages and for many mid-Eastern languages. This format is generally called ANSI. ANSI is gradually being replaced by a more flexible standard.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><em>Unicode</em>&nbsp;allows more 
extensive data formatting&nbsp;since it can&nbsp;use one, two or more bytes of 
data for each character.&nbsp;Unicode allows the representation of all the written languages in the world.</p>
<p class="BodyText">                          Adapt It used ANSI formatting to begin with, but has&nbsp;moved to Unicode as&nbsp;its standard. However, there has been a need to maintain two versions of Adapt It -- Adapt It Regular and Adapt&nbsp;It Unicode.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText">      The two versions of Adapt It differ in the internal representation of data. Adapt It Regular uses data storage which conforms to the ANSI standard. This standard supports Latin-based alphabets with some flexibility for specially designed characters. Adapt It Regular has been maintained to support translation projects that began with using the ANSI characters.</p>
<p class="BodyText">               Adapt It Unicode uses the Unicode standard internally, thus permitting it to support Eastern and mid-Eastern languages&nbsp;and any other non-Latin based scripts in addition to the Latin-based alphabets. Due to the greater flexibility of Unicode, we recommend that all new projects use Adapt It Unicode.</p>

  <li>
<div class="BodyText">                       Since Adapt It Regular version 4.0,&nbsp;all versions of Adapt It Regular&nbsp;actually use a subset of Unicode that works with the ANSI characters. However, files created in Adapt It Regular are still not usable by Adapt It Unicode and vice versa.</div></li></ul>
