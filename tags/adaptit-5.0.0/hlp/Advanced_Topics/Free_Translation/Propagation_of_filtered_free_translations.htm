<h2>Propagation of filtered free translations</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It&#39;s ability to <span class="DefinedWord">propagate</span> or pass on free translations from project to project makes it a powerful tool for saving time and effort in related language and cluster language projects. Free translations created for one language can be passed along to a project in another language. The new project can then use the free translation to assist in the adaptation process and as the basis for a free translation of the new language.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When you export the target language as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Standard_Format_Text_File.htm">standard format text file</a>, Adapt It propagates or passes along all filtered material as well. Since Adapt It free translations are always filtered, free translations are passed along as well. See <a href="../Filtering/Filtering_of_information.htm">Filtering of information</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>The advantages of propagating free translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Free translations do not have to be recreated from scratch, and are instantly and easily available for viewing and modification in each new project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The translator can view the free translations propagated from the original project during the current adaptation process. This technique can provide to the translator helpful clues about the intended meaning of the source text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Propagating free translations can save of time and effort if used with care. The free translations for related language projects and cluster language projects will often be very similar, so that only a small amount of editing may be necessary to make the free translation reflect any differences in the current target text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The danger of propagating free translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If a translator adopts a propagated free translation without changing it to reflect the actual meaning of the current adaptation, the translation consultant could be deceived about its quality.</p>
