# Introduction #

The default method for storing documents in an Adapt It project is to keep them all in a folder called _Adaptations_. This method works well when you do not need to store a large number of documents. However, if you have decided to break down a book into chapters, you may want to consider using Book Folder mode.

When you switch to Book Folder mode, Adapt It creates 67 subfolders in the Adaptations folder. Each of these folders is named for a book of the Bible with the addition of a generic folder called _Other Texts_. Thus you can store the adaptation documents for each book in its own folder.

# Procedure #

## Caveats on this procedure ##

There are many conditions under which you could convert to Book Folders Mode. This procedure is written with a scenario where you would be opening a new project and are going to work in the book of Luke. Converting to Book Folder mode can be done at anytime; however, the process is easiest with a project that does not yet have many documents. This is because Adapt It does not automatically move documents into the book folders.

A second assumption is that Adapt It is set to make automatic backups. So in this procedure the point is made about a document that includes BAK in the file extension. If you are not making automatic backups, you will not see this file and you can ignore that part of the procedure.

## Procedure steps ##

```
For the purposes of this procedure, assume that you wish to work with the book of Luke and you are creating a new project.
  1. Open the new project in Adapt It and proceed until you get to the Document Dialog. 
  2. Open your Luke document so that it appears in Adapt It’s Main Window.
  3. On the Advanced menu, click the "Storing Documents in Book Folders" option.
  4. Adapt It prompts you about saving the changes. Accept the changes.
     Adapt It saves the Luke document into the Adaptations folder for now.
  5. Adapt It Opens the Document dialog again. This time the Book Folder mode status should be On. 
     The dialog tells you that documents are being stored to a particular folder. Usually this will be Matthew. 
  6. Click the "Change Folder…" button. 
  7. Select "New Testament books" if it is not already selected.
  8. Select Luke in the Drop down box on the right.
  9. Click OK.
     Adapt It now wants you to select a document; however, you have saved Luke in the Adaptations folder. 
     Now, you just want to open the Luke folder so you can move the documents there. 
 10. Click Cancel. 
 11. Adapt It may give you several warning messages. Click OK to clear those messages. 
 12. Open the Tools menu and select the "Move Document…" option.
     Adapt It opens a "Move A Document" dialog showing all of the documents in the Adaptations folder. 
     Two of them should refer to Luke. Both have a file extension of xml and one also has a file extension of BAK.
 13. Be sure that the "From the Adaptations folder to the current book folder" option is selected.
 14. Select one of the two documents and click "Move Now".
     Adapt It tells you that the document has been successfully moved.
 15. Repeat the process for the second document.
 16. Click Close.
 17. Open the File menu and select the Open option or press Ctrl+O.
     Adapt It opens the Document dialog again and this time shows the two documents in the Luke folder. 
 18. Select the document which does not include BAK in the filename. (BAK stands for Backup.)
 19. Click Finish.
     Adapt It opens the main window with the document ready for adaptation.
