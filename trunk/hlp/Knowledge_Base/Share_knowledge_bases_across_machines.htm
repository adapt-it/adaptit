<h2>Share knowledge bases across machines</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Sometimes adaptation is done by a team using more than one computer. This means that the same project may have more than one knowledge base, since the adaptations developed on one machine do not automatically apply to the knowledge base on any other machine. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically copy the knowledge base entries of each machine into the knowledge base of the rest of the machine. This process requires two steps repeated as often as necessary.</p>

<p class="BodyText">You will need to develop your own procedure and schedule for this process. Each situation will vary depending on requirements. You may want to consider a circular process whereby you export from machine 1 to machine 2 then export the updated knowledge base from machine 2 to machine 3 and so forth. The last step would be export from the last machine, back onto machine 1. At the end all machines have the same entries; however, the order of the entries might be different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The process does <span class="Strong">not</span> create duplicate entries in the receiving knowledge base. Adapt It only imports entries not currently in the knowledge base. Therefore you do not be concerned if updates are applied multiple times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Importing does <span class="Strong">not</span> delete any entries from the receiving machine.</p>
