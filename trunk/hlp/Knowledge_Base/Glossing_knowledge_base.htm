<h2>Glossing knowledge base</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It maintains a glossing knowledge base for use when glossing is desired. (See <a href="../Advanced_Topics/Glossing/Glossing_overview.htm">Glossing overview</a>.) A glossing knowledge base works generally in the same way as an <a href="Adaptation_knowledge_base.htm">adaptation knowledge base</a>, but operates only when the document is in <a href="../Advanced_Topics/Glossing/Glossing_mode.htm">glossing mode</a>.</p>
<h4><img src="../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Glossing mode is more restrictive than adapting mode; so when glossing you cannot create <span class="DefinedWord">source text phrases</span>, insert <span class="DefinedWord">placeholders</span>, or do <span class="DefinedWord">retranslations</span>. Glossing mode only permits you to give a gloss for whatever source text is contained in a single <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span>. This source text may be a single word or a phrase (including punctuation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It does not automatically strip the punctuation, as in adapting mode. Thus, everything typed into the gloss including punctuation is stored in the glossing knowledge base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The glossing knowledge base does not organize its storage on the basis of the number of words in a gloss so all glosses are stored in the same location. By contrast, the adaptation knowledge base provides separate storage locations for words and phrases up to ten words in length. See <a href="Editing_a_KB/Select_phrase_by_number_of_words.htm">Select phrase by number of words</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
