<h2>Rename the current backup file to become a knowledge base file</h2>
<p class="BodyText">To use this option you need to have some knowledge of Windows folders and file management. Read the following procedure, <span class="Emphasis">before</span> attempting to do it. <span class="Emphasis">If you do not understand the procedure seek help from a person with more knowledge.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Locate the <span class="FileName">Adapt It</span> or <span class="FileName">Adapt It Unicode Work</span> folder on your computer. This folder is in the <span class="FileName">My Documents</span> folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Locate and open the folder containing the adaptations and knowledge base.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The name of the project folder has the format: <span class="FileName">“source language name” to “target language name” adaptations;</span> these names being the names used when you first created the project<span class="FileName">.</span> For example, <span class="FileName">French to English adaptations</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Make sure that you see the <span class="DefinedWord">filename extensions</span> for the files in this folder. If the filename extensions are not visible change the folder options to make them visible.</p>
<p class="BodyText">See <a href="../../Windows_Concepts/Make_Filename_Extensions_Visible.htm">Make filename extensions visible</a> for a procedure to do this in Windows XP. For other operating systems, use the Help menu in the folder to see how it is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Locate the knowledge base file. This file has the filename that includes the name of the project and the word <span class="FileName">adaptations</span>. The filename has a single extension of <span class="FileName">.XML</span>. <span class="Keyboard">Right click</span> the filename and select <span class="UserInterface">Delete</span> from the popup menu.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The computer deletes the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Locate the backup knowledge base file. This file has two filename extensions, <span class="FileName">.BAK</span> followed by <span class="FileName">.XML</span>. <span class="Keyboard">Right Click</span> the filename and select <span class="UserInterface">Rename</span> from the popup menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Select the characters <span class="FileName">.BAK</span> (including the period in the selection). Press <span class="Keyboard">Delete</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Backspace</span> and then click anywhere on the screen to make the change “stick”. Now only .XML should remain as the filename extension.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It can recognize this file as the knowledge base. You need to exit the application if you have not already done so. Launch Adapt It again. This time, Adapt It uses the former backup knowledge base as the current knowledge base.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><img src="../../Warning_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Warning</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Changing the filename extension of a file tells windows that the file is of a different type. As a result, Windows may try to use the wrong <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> with the file with unpredictable results. Do not attempt to change file extension types unless you know that the two file types are compatible.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If this procedure does not help, you can <a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/KB_Mngment/Restore_the_knowledge_base.htm">Restore the knowledge base</a>. Restoring the knowledge base quickly recreates a knowledge base using the adaptation documents for the project.</p>
