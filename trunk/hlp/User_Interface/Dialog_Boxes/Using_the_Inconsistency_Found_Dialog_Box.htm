<h2>Using the Inconsistency Found Dialog Box</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The Inconsistency Found dialog box has several areas to notice. The colors have been added for reference purposes.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/INCONSISTENCY_FOUND_MARKUP.PNG"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The upper left corner (highlighted in yellow) contains the word or phrase from the <span class="DefinedWord">source language</span>. There is also a listing of the location for the entry, which in this case is chapter 25, verse 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The upper right corner (highlighted in blue) contains the word or phrase in the target language as it is translated in the current document. This adaptation is not currently in the knowledge base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The list box on the left side shows any current translations for the words or phrases that are in the knowledge base associated with the source word shown at the top left, which is toktok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">In the center of the right hand side are three option buttons and a text box (highlighted in green) used to tell Adapt It how to deal with the inconsistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Select from the list on the left, to replace what is above</span>. To use this option, select one of the adaptations in the list box on the left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Accept what is above.</span> This option enters the adaptation at the top into the knowledge base (in the blue area).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Type a new one.</span> This option allows you to enter a new translation to be placed in the document and added to the knowledge base. Type the new translation into the text box to the right of this option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">The bottom right corner (highlighted in magenta) contains four command buttons and a check box.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Accept &lt;no adaptation&gt; for this item</span>. This command button enters the &lt;no adaptation&gt; entry into the database and clears the contents of the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box.</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">Click <span class="UserInterface">OK</span> to have Adapt It make these changes and to resume consistency checking at the next location in the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Ignore it, I will fix it later</span>. This command button tells Adapt It to do nothing and move on to the next location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Auto-fix the entry the same way</span>. This check box tells Adapt It to use the selected options (in the green area) for all future occurrences of this particular discrepancy. (You must click one of the command buttons to continue.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">OK</span>. This command button causes Adapt It to process the chosen option and resume consistency checking from the next location in the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Cancel</span>. This command button causes Adapt It to stop the consistency checking process; no changes are made for the current selection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
