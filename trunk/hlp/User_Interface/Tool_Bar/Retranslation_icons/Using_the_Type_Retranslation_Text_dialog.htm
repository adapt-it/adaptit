<h2>Using the Type Retranslation Text dialog</h2>
<p class="BodyText">When you click the <span class="UserInterface">Retranslation</span> or <span class="UserInterface">Edit Retranslation</span> button, Adapt It collects the text you have selected, and presents it to you in the <span class="UserInterface">Type Retranslation Text</span> dialog. The dialog shows you the preceding and following context of either the source text or target text (selectable by a button in the dialog), as well as any existing translation for the selected words. Then you can compose your new translation in the edit box provided. The dialog looks like this:</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../../Images/Type_Retranslation_Text_dialog.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">There are four text boxes in the dialog. You can change the contents of just the third text box. The remaining three text boxes give a context for your work. The top text box shows you the source text just prior to the passage to be retranslated. The second text box shows the source text of the passage, while the bottom text box shows the source just after the passage to be retranslated.</p>
<p class="BodyText">In the third text box (labeled <span class="UserInterface">Type the new translation text here</span>), Adapt It enters the current adaptation for the passage. The passage is selected so that as you type the first letter the entire adaptation is removed. To retain the selected text, click at the point in the text where you want to make a change, or press the <span class="Keyboard">Right arrow</span> key to position the cursor at the end of the text.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Once you are satisfied with the retranslation, click <span class="UserInterface">OK</span> to return to the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>. See <a href="Retranslate_selected_%20source_text.htm">Retranslate selected source text</a> for information about the use of the other command buttons.</p>
<p class="BodyText">At this point, the retranslation appears instead of the adaptation. See <a href="../../../Adapt_It_Concepts/Retranslation.htm">Retranslation</a> for more information.</p>
