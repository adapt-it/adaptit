<h2>Mode Bar</h2>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/MODE_BAR.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">The Mode bar controls the operations of Adapt It and allows you to change how you work with Adapt It.</p>
<h3>Drafting vs. Reviewing Mode</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The first two option buttons from the left force a choice between Drafting mode and Reviewing Mode. Drafting mode is the standard mode for making adaptations. As you enter translations, Adapt It saves them in the knowledge base and uses them for further translations. The three check boxes control how Drafting mode operates. For more information see <a href="Drafting_Option_box/Drafting_mode.htm">Drafting mode</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Reviewing_Option_box/Reviewing_mode.htm">Reviewing mode</a> allows you to step through the document one word or phrase at a time. As the name suggests reviewing mode allows you the change to examine each adaptation carefully and to make changes as necessary. In reviewing mode, automatic mode is not available.</p>
<h3>Automatic Mode</h3>
<p class="BodyText">When this checkbox is selected, Adapt It automatically inserts known translations into empty locations. It only stops when it cannot determine the translation. This mode is called <a href="Automatic_Checkbox/Automatic_mode.htm">Automatic mode</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If the checkbox is not selected, Adapt It proceeds in . This mode stops at each empty location after it inserts the translation. You must press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> to proceed.</p>
<h3>Save to Knowledge Base</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It saves all adaptations to the knowledge base. If you do not want to store the translation in <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> into the knowledge base, see <a href="Save_to_Knowledge_Base_Checkbox/Clear_the_Save_To_Knowledge_Base_checkbox.htm">Clear the Save To Knowledge Base checkbox</a>.</p>
<h3>Force Choice for This Item</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The first time you encounter a source word and you know that there are multiple translations for the word, you should select this checkbox. This action causes Adapt It to stop every time it encounters the word and allows you to enter other translations as needed. Otherwise, Adapt It enters the first translation every time it finds the word.</p>
<p class="BodyText">After pressing <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, Adapt It moves to the next word or phrase and unselects the checkbox.</p>
<h3>&lt;no adaptation&gt;</h3>
<p class="BodyText">If the word in the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> does not need a translation, click on the <span class="UserInterface">&lt;no adaptation&gt;</span> command button. Adapt It makes a &lt;no adaptation&gt; entry into the knowledge base for this source language word and places no entry into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. Use this control carefully since Adapt It leaves the target cell empty for every occurrence of the source word unless you have set <span class="UserInterface">Force Choice for this item</span>. See <a href="No_Adaptation_Command/the_%20no_adaptation_button.htm">The &lt;no&gt; adaptation button</a></p>
<h3>Delay</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Delay</span> textbox tells you if Adapt It slows the process of moving the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. The number in the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> is the number of hundredths of a second Adapt It delays the motion. Using delay allows you to see better what Adapt It is doing and assists you to make corrections as they are necessary.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It allows up to a 3 second delay (300 hundredths of a second).</p>
<p class="BodyText">You cannot change the rate of delay in the textbox. To change the amount of delay, use the <span class="UserInterface">Delay</span> option of the .</p>
<h3>Glossing mode</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The glossing mode checkbox appears only if the <a href="../Menu_Bar/Advanced_Menu/Glossing_Management.htm">See Glossing</a> option of the <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span> menu has been selected. If you check this box, Adapt It moves the <span class="UserInterface">Glossing</span> line into the position below the <span class="UserInterface">Source text</span> line of each strip. The <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> now appears in the glossing line. Adapt It moves the <span class="UserInterface">Target text</span> line below the glossing line, and cannot be changed. See <a href="../../Advanced_Topics/Glossing/Glossing_mode.htm">Glossing mode</a> for more information about the uses and restrictions on operating in Glossing mode.</p>
