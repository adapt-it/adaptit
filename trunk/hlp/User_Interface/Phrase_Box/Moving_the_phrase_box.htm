<h2>Moving the phrase box</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The majority of your work in Adapt It involves the use of the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>. You can move the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> by several methods. Depending on the type of movement, Adapt It may change the contents of the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> differently.</p>
<h3>Normal Phrase box movement with adaptation</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Most movement of the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> occurs as part of the <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> process. When you press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> moves to the next available empty location or <span class="DefinedWord">hole</span><a class="popupspot" title="" href="">.</a> In doing so, Adapt It automatically moves through each location and retrieves the current adaptation for each <span class="DefinedWord">source</span> word or phrase from the <span class="DefinedWord">knowledge base</span>. If the knowledge base contains more than one adaptation, the process stops and Adapt It presents the user with a dialog box. This dialog box allows you to select the correct adaptation, or enter a new one. Then you choose the best adaptation and press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>. The process resumes until a hole is found or another adaptation decision is required.</p>
<h3>Manual movement of the Phrase box</h3>
<p class="BodyText">You can quickly move around in an Adapt It document by clicking on the area below a <span class="DefinedWord">source</span> word or phrase. This topic is covered in <a href="Manual_movement_of_phrase_box.htm">Manual movement of Phrase box</a>.</p>
<h3>Moving backward one location at a time</h3>
<p class="BodyText">In some cases, you may want to move backward one location at a time, perhaps to make a correction. When you press either <span class="Keyboard">Shift+Tab</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Shift+Enter</span> the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> moves one space backward. Adapt It does not provide a way to move forward one location at a time in <span class="DefinedWord">drafting mode</span>.</p>
<h3>Movement in reviewing mode</h3>
<p class="BodyText">In <span class="DefinedWord">reviewing mode</span> you can press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> to move the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> forward one location at a time. In this mode, Adapt It does not do any lookups in the knowledge base, nor does it copy the source text if the location is empty.</p>
