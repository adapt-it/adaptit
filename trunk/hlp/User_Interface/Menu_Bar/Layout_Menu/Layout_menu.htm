<h2>Layout menu</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The Layout menu appears only in Adapt It Unicode and has only one option.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../../Images/LAYOUT_MENU.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option allows you to change the direction of the text. If your language reads right to left, this option changes the direction. It is a <span class="DefinedWord">toggle</span> to allowing you to change the direction back to Left to Right (the default mode).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You can also change the text direction by pressing <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl+1</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Changing the direction of the text can be very useful it the source and target languages have a different directionality. For example, if you were adapting from Hebrew into Russian, generally you would use Right to Left directionality. However, by temporarily switching to Left to Right directionality, you could better read the adaptation results in the target language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You can change the direction of text at any time while adapting. The option does not change the structure of the document but only how it is presented in the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Automatic insertions of adaptations work correctly even if the directionality is incorrect for the source text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
