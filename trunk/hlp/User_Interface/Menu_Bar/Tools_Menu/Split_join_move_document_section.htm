<h3>Split a document into smaller pieces</h3>
<p class="BodyText">You can split large documents into several smaller documents by using <span class="UserInterface">Split</span> <span class="UserInterface">Document…</span> option. As Adapt It nears the end of a large document, its performance may slow as it makes automatic changes. Splitting a document in half and working in end half may improve performance. Splitting a document is also useful when preparing documents for use in low power machines such as the AlphaSmart Dana. Such machines may have difficulty working with large documents. See <a href="Split_a_document.htm">Split a document</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Join two or more documents into a single document</h3>
<p class="BodyText">In the case where you need to combine two or more documents into a larger document, you can use the <a href="Join_documents.htm">Join Documents…</a> option to accomplish this task. The documents that you join should be part of the same book. Be careful to ensure that you join the documents in the correct sequence so that the chapters will not be out of order.</p>
<h3>Move a document from the Adaptations folder to a Book folder or vice versa</h3>
<p class="BodyText">If you have decided to use <a href="../../../Adapt_It_Structure/Proj_and_Docs/Book_folders_mode.htm">Book folders mode</a>, you may need to move documents from the Adaptations folder to the appropriate book folder. The <a href="../../Dialog_Boxes/Move_a_document_dialog.htm">Move A Document</a> option allows you to move these documents.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Alternatively, if you have been working in Book folders mode and decide not to use this mode anymore; you will need to move the documents into the Adaptations folder. The Move A Document option allows you to do this as well. (You may find it helpful to rejoin small split off documents into one larger one and then move the large document. See <a href="Join_documents.htm">Join documents</a>.)</p>
