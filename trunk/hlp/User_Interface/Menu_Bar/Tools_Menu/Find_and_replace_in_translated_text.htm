<h2>Find and replace in translated text</h2>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../../Images/find_and_replace_dialog.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">By default, the dialog assumes you want to search in the translation text. The <span class="UserInterface">Translated Text Only</span> option is selected as shown above.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You can type your search text into the <span class="UserInterface">Translation:</span> text box. The search text does not have to be an entire word but also can be any part of a word. Adapt It highlights the entire word in yellow, even though the matched text is a fragment of the word.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The default mode of search is case-sensitive meaning that that Adapt It treats “A” as a different character than “a”. You can have Adapt It ignore the differences by checking the <span class="UserInterface">Ignore Case</span> <img src="../../../Images/ignore_case.GIF"> check box.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It assumes you want to search the lines without punctuation. If you wish to search the line with punctuation, check the <span class="UserInterface">Search in lines which retain punctuation</span> <img src="../../../Images/search_in_punct_line.GIF">check box. Adapt It then searches the line with punctuation. This feature is useful if you need to find a particular punctuation mark.</p>
<p class="BodyText">At times you may want to find a particular combination of words phrase, but you have not <a href="../../Tool_Bar/Phrase_icons/Make_a_phrase.htm">made them into a phrase</a>. In this case, you need to have Adapt It, search for the words using multiple piles, not just one. To do this, check the <span class="UserInterface">Allow the search to occur in text spanning multiple piles</span> <img src="../../../Images/search_span.GIF"> check box. This feature may be useful if you do want to convert the word combination into a phrase.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When you have determined what you are searching for you can enter the replacement text into the <span class="UserInterface">Replacement Text:</span> text box. Then you can click one of the command buttons on the right hand side:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Find Next</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option searches the document to find the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Translation:</span> text box and positions the active location at the pile containing the match. Nothing is replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Replace</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option replaces the matched text with the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Replacement Text:</span> text box. You may have to use the <span class="UserInterface">Find Next</span> option to position the active location at the matched text.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If your match finds part of a word, Adapt It replaces only the word fragment with the replacement text, the remainder of the word remains as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Replace All</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option searches through the entire document starting at the active location replacing every occurrence of the text in the <span class="UserInterface">Translation:</span> text box with the replacement text. The starting active location does not have to be at a match.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Use this option carefully; you can easily make changes that you do not want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Cancel</span></p>
<p class="BodyText">This option closes the dialog without making doing any additional changes. It does not undo any changes that you have already made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
