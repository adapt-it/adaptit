<h2>The Adapt It user interface control bars</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It user interface follows many of the Windows application standards. However, the unique features in Adapt It require special icons and tools. At the top of the interface are four control bars used to control and manage Adapt It’s features, although the <span class="UserInterface">Compose</span> bar is generally hidden. The top two bars are typical of most Windows applications while the last two bars are unique to Adapt It.</p>
<h4><a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/Menu_Bar.htm">Menu</a></h4>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Menu</span> control bar follows the basic organization of most Windows applications. This control bar contains <span class="UserInterface">File</span>, <span class="UserInterface">Edit</span>, <span class="UserInterface">View</span>, <span class="UserInterface">Tools</span>, <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span>, and <span class="UserInterface">Help</span> menus. The <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span> menu is unique to Adapt It. In addition to these menus, Adapt It Unicode also has a <span class="UserInterface">Layout</span> menu. To use any of these menus, click on the desired item and a drop-down menu appears.</p>
<h4><a href="../../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Tool_Bar.htm">Tools</a></h4>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Tool</span><span class="UserInterface">s</span> control bar contains basic editing and printing icons contained in most Windows toolbars. There also a number of Adapt It specific icons as well.</p>
<h4><a href="../../User_Interface/Mode_Bar/Mode_Bar.htm">Mode</a></h4>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Mode</span> bar contains several option buttons and checkboxes, along with a command button and a text box. The purpose of the Mode bar is to change temporarily your preferences as to how Adapt It should do its work.</p>
<h4><a href="../../User_Interface/Compose_bar/Compose_bar.htm">Compose</a></h4>
<p class="BodyText">Usually, Adapt It hides the <span class="UserInterface">Compose</span> bar. This control bar provides you with a way to try out phrases as if you were using a “scratchpad.” When you are satisfied with the wording, you can transfer the material to the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box,</span> an Adapt It dialog box, or some other location.</p>
