<h2>Punctuation Correspondence table</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It automatically copies the punctuation of the <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> into the <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span> as it does <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span>. In order to accomplish this task, Adapt It uses the Punctuation Correspondence table. The Punctuation Correspondence table has two primary purposes:</p>
<h3>Defining Punctuation</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Since each language has its own punctuation rules and definitions, Adapt It needs to know how to distinguish punctuation symbols from alphabetic characters. The application assumes that any symbols entered into the Punctuation Correspondence table are punctuation symbols. Any symbols not found in the table are assumed to be alphabetic characters. Therefore, <span class="Strong">it is important for you to make sure all</span> <span class="Strong">punctuation</span> <span class="Strong">symbols used in the source and target languages are included in the table</span>. See <a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Managing_Punctuation.htm">Managing Punctuation</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Specifying Corresponding Punctuation Symbols</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The punctuation symbols used in the target language may be entirely different than those used in the source language. The Punctuation Correspondence table allows you to enter each source language punctuation symbol and the corresponding target language symbol.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It finds a punctuation symbol in the source text, it enters the corresponding symbol into the target text.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You can edit the Punctuation Correspondence table by using either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <a href="../../Getting_Started/Launching_Adapt_It/Punctuation_dialog.htm">Punctuation dialog</a> when you initially launch the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Punctuation_tab.htm">Punctuation tab</a>, after you have established the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">In some cases, either the source language or the target language may have a punctuation symbol which has no corresponding symbol in the other language. You must still enter these symbols into the Punctuation Corresponding table. Otherwise, Adapt It cannot recognize these symbols as punctuation and will treat them as part of the associated word. See <a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Punctuation_management_rules.htm">Punctuation Management rules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">It the target language requires a punctuation symbol, but the source language does not contain a corresponding symbol, you must key in the symbol as needed in the target text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
