<h2>The Adapt It user interface</h2>
<p class="BodyText">A <span class="DefinedWord">user interface</span> is what you as the user of an <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> sees as you work with 
the computer to do your task. Adapt It has its own unique interface, because it 
is a unique application. If you are familiar with other Windows applications you 
will recognize similarities to those programs. However, since Adapt It is a 
language <em>adaptation </em>application, it has many features not included in 
other applications.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It <span class="DefinedWord">user interface</span> follows many of the standards for 
Windows application. However, in addition to the standard portions of the user interface, Adapt It contains a number of&nbsp;special structures, icons and tools. These unique features can be seen in the&nbsp;two main divisions of the interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Adapt_It_user_interface_control_bars.htm">Adapt It user interface control bars</a></p>
<p class="BodyText">At the top of the interface are four bars used to control and manage Adapt It's features. Three bars are normally visible, with the fourth bar invisible until requested by the user. The control and management bars contain menus and Adapt It icons used to perform application functions.</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/AI_Main_Window/Main_window.htm">Main window</a></p>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It main window is below the 
  control bars. The main window is where the most of the work is done. The 
  purpose is to enter and manage text through the use of the <a 
  href="../../User_Interface/Phrase_Box/Phrase_Box.htm">Phrase 
box</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
