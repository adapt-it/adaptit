<h2>Configuration files</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It requires the use of certain files called <span class="DefinedWord">configuration files</span>. These files contain data about the <span class="DefinedWord">projects</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">documents a</span>nd your preferences for working with the <span class="DefinedWord">application</span>. Adapt It builds and maintains these files automatically. You should not attempt to change these files on your own, but only by using the tools provided by Adapt It.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Configuration settings include such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Font sizes and colors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Preferences about the format of the Main window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Backup and saving preferences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It stores the settings you use in two types of configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="General_Configuration_file.htm">General Configuration file</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Project_Configuration_file.htm">Project Configuration file</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">In addition, each document file contains some configuration information. The data contained in these three kinds of files overlap to some degree. The general configuration file contains default preferences for all projects. The project configuration file contains preferences for its project. These preferences override those in the general configuration file. For example, you could change the source font color in a document, and all of the documents in the project would use that color for the source text. The document file contains preferences for the specific document such as the specific <a href="../../../Advanced_Topics/Filtering/Filtering_of_information.htm">filters</a> you wish to use. Adapt It uses the filters for the current document but not for other document. You can set unique filters for any document.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If Adapt It fails on your attempt to launch it, the configuration files may be corrupt. You can rebuild the General Configuration file by pressing the <span class="Keyboard">Shift</span> key while launching Adapt It again. Release the <span class="Keyboard">Shift</span> key once the <span class="UserInterface">Welcome to Adapt It</span> screen appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">To rebuild the Project Configuration file for a specific project, do the same as above but continue to press the <span class="Keyboard">Shift</span> key until you reach the <span class="UserInterface">Document</span> page of the <span class="UserInterface">Start Working</span> wizard. Release the <span class="Keyboard">Shift</span> key to rebuild the Project Configuration file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
