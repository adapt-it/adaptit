<h2>The Adapt It folder organization</h2>
<p class="BodyText">When the user installs Adapt It, the installation process creates a folder structure to support the adaptation process. This structure works at several levels:</p>
<h3>The Adapt It or Adapt It Unicode Work folder</h3>
<p class="BodyText">This folder is the highest-level folder and contains all of the subfolders necessary for the adaptation process. Adapt It creates the <span class="FileName">Work</span> folder as a subfolder of the <span class="FileName">My Documents</span> folder. The Work folder contains the <span class="FileName">Project Adaptation</span> folders. It also contains a configuration file that defines the Adapt It user interface preferences.</p>
<h3>Project Adaptation folders</h3>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="FileName">Project Adaptation</span> folders are subfolders of the <span class="FileName">Work</span> folder. Each adaptation folder represents one project. The folder name contains the name of the project, for example <span class="FileName">Tok Pisin to English</span> <span class="FileName">Adaptations.</span> Each folder contains an <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span> subfolder and several files that Adapt It needs to perform the adaptation process. The most important of these files is the <span class="DefinedWord">knowledge base</span> file.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It application maintains these files and the user <span class="Strong">should not</span> attempt to modify them in anyway other than through Adapt It tools.</p>
<h3>Adaptations subfolders</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span> subfolder contains the document files for the project or Book subfolders. Adapt It maintains these files and the user <span class="Strong">should not</span> attempt to directly read or modify them in anyway other than through the Adapt It application.</p>
<h3>Book subfolders</h3>
<p class="BodyText">If <a href="../../Proj_and_Docs/Book_folders_mode.htm">Book folders mode</a> is on Adapt It uses another level of subfolders. The <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span> subfolder contains the book subfolders. There are 67 of these subfolders -- one for each book of the Bible and a generic folder called <span class="FileName">Other Texts</span>. Each of the book subfolders contains documents for a particular book of the Bible.</p>
<p class="BodyText">This arrangement provides several benefits. It keeps the number of documents in a subfolder to a manageable size so that you do not have to create a new project for each new book. In addition, the knowledge base created for one book is instantly available to all of the other books. You do not have to <a href="../../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/KB_Mngment/Exporting_knowledge_base_entries.htm">export knowledge base entries</a> to another project each time you start on a new book.</p>
