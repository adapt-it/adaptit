<h2>Data formats acceptable to Adapt It</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The two data formats acceptable to Adapt It are the American National Standard Institute <span class="DefinedWord">ANSI</span> standard and <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span>.</p>
<h3>ANSI</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The ANSI standard is an older data format that has been used with computers for many years. This standard has worked well with Latin-based alphabets because each ANSI character can be one of 255 possibilities. Non-Latin-based alphabets can be much more complex and may require many more possibilities.</p>
<h3>Unicode</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The Unicode standard is a newer data format which allows 65536 combinations or more and thus can be used for complex non-Latin based fonts. However, Unicode can only be used with Windows 2000 or newer machines since the older computers and operating systems cannot use this format.</p>
