<h2>XML in Adapt It</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The legacy versions of Adapt It and Adapt It Unicode (versions 2.4.1i and earlier) saved their documents and knowledge bases in only one way--as <span class="DefinedWord">binary files</span>. In the case of documents these had an extension .adt while for knowledge bases the extension used was .KB.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Version 3 introduced a new default for input and output. Documents and knowledge bases are saved in XML format, and the filename extension is .<span class="FileName">xml</span> (lower case) for both.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To allow translators to change from a legacy version to the current version, Adapt It still supports the use of .adt binary files.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">File</span> menu <span class="UserInterface">Save Documents and KB As XML</span> command turns on, or off, saving of documents and knowledge bases as XML. When turned off, the saving is done in binary format. We recommend that you leave the option turned on. See <a href="../../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/Save_Documents_and_KB_As_XML.htm">Save Documents and KB As XML</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Processing XML data is slightly slower than binary data and XML documents are also a little larger. However, XML data can be edited directly by an Adapt It consultant, if necessary. Binary data cannot be edited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It reads either file type equally well, regardless of the current setting for the format used when saving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <a href="../../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/Save_Documents_and_KB_As_XML.htm">Save Documents and KB As XML</a> command&#39;s setting only affects the file format used for saving, it is ignored when opening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You can open a document in one format (e.g. binary) and save it in the other format (e.g. XML) or vice versa. If you do this, Adapt It removes the file with the old format and writes a new one in the new format. Therefore, there is only one version of the file at any given time.</p>
