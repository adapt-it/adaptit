<h2>XML Documents and KBs</h2>
<p class="BodyText">When you first run Adapt It, the <a href="../../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/Save_Documents_and_KB_As_XML.htm">Save Documents and KB As XML</a> option is turned on (the default setting). We recommend that you leave it turned on. XML is more complex than binary only and its input and output is slightly slower. XML documents are also a little larger. These disadvantages are outweighed by the fact that XML documents can be read by humans and edited if necessary. This makes it possible for an Adapt It consultant to fix a faulty document. If you turn the command off (by clicking on it) then documents and knowledge bases will be saved in binary format, as in the <span class="DefinedWord">legacy versions</span>.</p>
