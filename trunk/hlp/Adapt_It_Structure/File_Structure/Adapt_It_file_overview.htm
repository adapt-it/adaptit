<h2>Adapt It file overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">A computer file is collection of data that a computer can read or write. The data in the file must be in a format that the computer can recognize. Applications such as Adapt It use files to store data for future use.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It uses several types of files to accomplish its tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Adapt_It_document_files.htm">Document files</a>. Documents are the primary unit of work in Adapt It. A document is a computer file that contains at a minimum contains <span class="DefinedWord">source language text</span>. As adaptation occurs the document contains <span class="DefinedWord">target language text</span>. The document may also contain <span class="DefinedWord">gloss text</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">free translations</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">back translations</span>, and <span class="DefinedWord">notes</span>. Each file contains the source material that is to be adapted. Depending on your approach a document could contain an entire book, such as Romans, or a single chapter of a book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../Adapt_It_Concepts/Knowledge_base_overview.htm">Knowledge base</a>. Knowledge bases are special files used by Adapt It to manage <span class="DefinedWord">adaptations</span> of <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span>. As you adapt source text, Adapt It captures each unique source language word or phrase and the corresponding adaptation word(s) you supply in the <span class="DefinedWord">target</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">glossing</span> language. It then stores these corresponding words and phrases into the knowledge base. As Adapt It encounters a source word or phrase that has already been entered, the <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> then places the target adaptation in the knowledge base into the target text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Config_files/Configuration_files.htm">Configuration files</a>. These files help Adapt It to control how it does its work. These files contain information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Your <a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Managing_Preferences.htm">user interface preferences</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Auto_saving_tab.htm">Saving</a> and <a href="../../User_Interface/Preferences/Backups_and_KB_tab.htm">backing up</a> files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../UI_Structure/Punctuation_Correspondence_table.htm">Punctuation correspondence</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
