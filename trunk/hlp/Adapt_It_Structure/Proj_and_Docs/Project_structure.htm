<h2>Project structure</h2>
<h3>This topic needs to be completed.</h3>
<p class="BodyText">A project is a collection of all the files and documents necessary for Adapt It to carry out its work. Each project deals with two languages: the <span class="DefinedWord">Source language</span> and the <span class="DefinedWord">Target language</span>. The input documents which are to be adapted are in the in the source language. The output documents of the process are in the target language. Adapt It stores the projects and its files in a computer folder. This folder is usually named for the two languages used by the project. The project folder contains the knowledge bases and at least one subfolder named <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span>. The adaptations folder contains the adaptation documents, either in the subfolder or one or more of the Book folders.</p>
<h3>Project folder</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The project folder is created when you first start the project. (See <a href="../../Getting_Started/Launching_Adapt_It/Create_a_project.htm">Create a project</a> for more information.) During this process you have to specify the Source language name and the Target language name. Adapt It uses these language names to build the project folder name.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The project folder contains an adaptation knowledge base and its backup; a glossing knowledge base and its backup if glossing is used; and a configuration file.</p>
<h3>Adaptation folder</h3>
<h3>Book folders</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It has a feature which can automatically create a series of subfolders within the Adaptation folder. These folders</p>
<h3>Documents</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Supporting information about the concept.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Can include a definition of critical features, examples, non-examples, and analogies.</p>
