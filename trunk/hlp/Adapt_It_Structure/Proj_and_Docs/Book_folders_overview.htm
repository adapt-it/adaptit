<h2>Book folders overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Since Adapt It has been developed primarily as a Bible translation tool, it contains a feature to assist with the organization of scripture texts. This feature is the ability to automatically create 67 subfolders within an Adapt It project; one subfolder for each of the canonical books of the Bible and an <span class="FileName">Other Texts</span> subfolder. The Other Texts subfolder is a place where other documents could be stored. To use this feature, Adapt It must be set to Book folders mode. See <a href="Book_folders_mode.htm">Book folders mode</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Book folders mode is useful when you expect to have use multiple documents for each book to be translated. For example, you may wish to have one document for each chapter of the book. In this way all documents associated with a particular Biblical book are stored in the same location and are easy to find.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You may <span class="Emphasis">not</span> want to use book folders mode when the adaptation process is well underway and the project is well organized with well understood procedures.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">A decision to use or not use Book folders mode should be made early in the project. Once many documents have been adapted, it can be very tedious to move them to a different folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The book folders are contained in the <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span> folder. Documents may be stored in both the <span class="FileName">Adaptations</span> folder and the books subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Once the book subfolders are created, they remain even if Book folders mode is turned off. The subfolders and the documents are not visible to Adapt It.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If Book folder mode is on, documents in the Adaptations folder are not visible in Adapt It other than in the <a href="../../User_Interface/Dialog_Boxes/Move_a_document_dialog.htm">Move a document dialog</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
