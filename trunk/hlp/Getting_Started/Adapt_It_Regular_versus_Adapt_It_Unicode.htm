<h2>Adapt It (Regular) versus Adapt It Unicode</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> comes in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It (Regular) is designed for use with Windows systems which do not support <span class="DefinedWord">Unicode</span>. This version works with ANSI or multibyte encoding systems (MBCS). It can support the uses of <span class="DefinedWord">hacked legacy fonts</span>. Thus, all computers using operating systems from Windows 95 on can run Adapt It (Regular).</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"> Adapt It Unicode represents its data internally as UTF-16 Unicode. This version can be run on Windows NT or 2000, but in order to fully support complex writing systems including right to left reading order, you need to run Windows XP, or newer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">Both forms of the application use XML coding to externally store the data as on the hard drive. XML is a markup computer language that makes it possible for humans to read highly structured data.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Even though both Adapt It versions use XML, Adapt It (Regular) cannot use files created by Adapt It Unicode and vice versa. This is because the underlying encodings for data files are different. To avoid the possibility of confusion among the files Adapt It (Regular) and Adapt It Unicode store their data files in different folders. See <a href="Launching_Adapt_It_the_first_time.htm">Launching Adapt It the first time</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Which version should I use?</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It Unicode is the most powerful version of the two and should be used unless you are dealing with one or more of following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The computers being used&nbsp;have operating systems&nbsp;older than Windows&nbsp;XP and cannot be upgraded.</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Your existing data meets the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The data is not encoded as Unicode</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Contains a well established set of hacked legacy fonts for your data</p>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Converting the data to Unicode would be a major task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
