<h2>Saving files versus backup</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The concepts of saving files and backup are related topics and easily confused. However, it is important to understand the difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Saving <span class="DefinedWord">files</span> means that the work you have done in the current Adapt It work session is saved to the hard disk in a file that can be directly used by the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Backup means that a <span class="DefinedWord">document</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">knowledge base</span> is copied to a different file with a filename that usually includes the filename extension <span class="FileName">BAK</span>. This file must be renamed in order to be usable by the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Saving files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">As you work in Adapt It, your work is recorded in the memory of the computer and not directly to the hard disk. If the computer should fail for some reason, the work done during the session will be lost. To lessen the impact of such a failure, Adapt It automatically saves files to the hard disk. Normally, Adapt It saves the files every 10 minutes. Adapt It also saves the file when you close a document or project. You have the ability to turn off <a href="../User_Interface/Preferences/Auto_saving_tab.htm">automatic saving</a> or change the interval. Adapt It also will ask you if you want to save changes when you close the project.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Saving files assures that the most recent version of your work is available the next time you work on a document.</p>
<h3>Backup files</h3>
<p class="BodyText">A backup file adds an additional level of security to saving files. The backup file contains a copy of documents and knowledge bases as of the last time you worked on them. This file is in addition to the saved file. Thus, if the saved file has been destroyed or damaged, you can use the backup file to replace it.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It automatically creates backups of knowledge bases at the end of an Adapt It session; however you may specify that <a href="../User_Interface/Preferences/Backups_and_KB_tab.htm">documents be backed</a> up as well.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Backup files are not as current as saved files.</p>
