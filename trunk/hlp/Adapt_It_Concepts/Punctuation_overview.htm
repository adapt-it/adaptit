<h2>Punctuation overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Punctuation is the set of symbols used to assist the reader understand the meaning of the text. Adapt It treats punctuation symbols as separate from words and phrases other than when a symbol is a necessary part of the word. An example of this is the use of a single quote symbol (&#39;) as a glottal stop symbol.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It has to deal with punctuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">To define what symbols should be considered as punctuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">To define corresponding punctuation symbols between the <span class="DefinedWord">source</span> and <span class="DefinedWord">target languages</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">To handle punctuation when creating phrases, doing retranslations, and making free translations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defining punctuation symbols</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It has a table of punctuation marks that defines the punctuation symbols. Adapt It treats any symbol not defined in the table as a letter or character used for building a word. When starting a new project, Adapt It defines the table using basic Latin-based punctuation symbols. You are responsible for adding or deleting symbols as required by your languages. See <a href="../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Managing_Punctuation.htm">Managing Punctuation</a>.</p>
<h3>Specifying corresponding punctuation symbols</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The Adapt It punctuation table contains entries for both the source and target languages. These entries are used to adapt the punctuation marks. In many cases, the symbols are the same in both the source and target languages. Where they are not, you need to supply the corresponding entries in the table. See <a href="../User_Interface/Preferences/Punctuation/Managing_Punctuation.htm">Managing Punctuation</a>.</p>
<h3>Punctuation in phrases, retranslations and free translations</h3>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It creates a <span class="DefinedWord">phrase</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">retranslation,</span> or <span class="DefinedWord">free translation,</span> the word order is changed and thus it cannot automatically place punctuation properly. For phrases, Adapt It provides a <a href="../User_Interface/Phrase_Box/Placement_Of_Phrase-Medial_Punctuation.htm">dialog</a> to assist you in placing the punctuation. However, for retranslations and free translations you must enter the needed punctuation yourself.</p>
