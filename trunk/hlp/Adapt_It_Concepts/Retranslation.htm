<h2>Retranslation</h2>
<p class="BodyText">With Adapt It, the term <span class="DefinedWord">retranslation</span> means that you enter your own translation of a passage rather than accepting the <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> produced by Adapt It. Generally, you use retranslations when the syntax or <span class="DefinedWord">exegesis</span> of the adaptation is incorrect or misleading. By <a href="Basic_work_procs/Selecting_source_text.htm">selecting specific source text</a>, you determine the amount of text to retranslate. Click the <a href="../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Retranslation_icons/Retranslate_selected_%20source_text.htm">retranslation icon</a> to begin the retranslation process.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When you retranslate a passage, the retranslation replaces any previous adaptations. Although Adapt It aligns the individual words of the retranslation below individual words of the source text, there is no meaningful relation between the source text words and the words of the retranslation target text words that are shown immediately below them. For this reason, Adapt It treats a retranslation as a &quot;whole&quot;. You cannot, for example, place the phrase box within a retranslation. If you want to edit a retranslation, or remove it, you must use the <a href="../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Retranslation_icons/Edit_a_retranslation.htm">edit retranslation</a> or <a href="../User_Interface/Tool_Bar/Retranslation_icons/Remove_a_retranslation.htm">remove a retranslation</a> buttons.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The beginning of a retranslation is marked by a <span class="UserInterface">#</span> sign in the <span class="UserInterface">Navigation</span> line. A star “<span class="UserInterface">*</span>” in the <span class="UserInterface">Navigation</span> line marks each word of the retranslation source. The star indicates that the word is not entered into the knowledge base.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Your retranslation does not have to be the same length as the section of source text you selected. If your retranslation is shorter than the source text, some words at the end of the passage will have empty spaces in the target text area. On the other hand, if your retranslation is longer than the source, Adapt It inserts <span class="DefinedWord">placeholders</span> at the end of the source text. These act as if they were words and the extra retranslation words fill the spaces below the placeholders. Placeholders take the form of ellipses which consists of three dots “<span class="Keyboard">…”.</span></p>
