<h2>About Adapt It</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It is a computer <span class="DefinedWord">application</span> that assists language translators in the conversion of text from one language to another. Since Adapt It is designed for use with <span class="Emphasis">languages that are closely related</span>, we use the term <span class="DefinedWord">adaptation</span> (rather than <span class="DefinedWord">translation</span>) to describe the process. With adaptation, the <span class="DefinedWord">exegesis</span> of the translation being done in the <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span> is dependent upon the translation done earlier in the <span class="DefinedWord">source language</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The heart of Adapt It is its use of <span class="DefinedWord">knowledge bases</span>. These files capture the adaptations of source text words and phrases. The knowledge base allows Adapt It to <span class="Emphasis">automatically</span> apply these adaptations to the same words and phrases as it encounters them later in the text. See <a href="Knowledge_base_overview.htm">Knowledge base overview</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="BodyText">In addition to the basic adaptation process, Adapt It has a number of capabilities that can assist you in creating translations. See <a href="What_tasks_can_Adapt_It_do.htm">What tasks can Adapt It do?</a> for more information.</p>
