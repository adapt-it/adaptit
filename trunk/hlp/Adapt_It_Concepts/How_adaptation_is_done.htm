<h2>How adaptation is done</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adaptation is a process of converting text from one language to another closely related language. The technique is particularly effective when the two languages have similar grammatical structures and the words of one language are related to the words of the other. Thus, a translator can create a new translation in the second language by <span class="Emphasis">adapting</span> a translation in the first language. We call the first language the <span class="DefinedWord">source language</span> and the second language the <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It is a computer application that automates a large part of the adaptation process. This program is not required to do adaptation but it can significantly speed up the process. See <a href="How_Adapt_It_does_adaptation.htm">How Adapt It does adaptation</a>.</p>
