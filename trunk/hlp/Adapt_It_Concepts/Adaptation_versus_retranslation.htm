<h2>Adaptation versus Retranslation</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapting a text means that the meaning or <span class="DefinedWord">exegesis</span> of the source text can be maintained by replacement of <span class="DefinedWord">source language</span> words and phrases with <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span> words and phrases. In some cases, such as idioms, simple replacement does not adequately represent the original meaning. In these cases, the adaptation must include a <span class="DefinedWord">retranslation</span> of the meaning.</p>
<p class="BodyText">With Adapt It, the term retranslation refers to the situation when you as the translator choose not to accept the adaptation produced by the application, but rather choose to enter your own translation of the passage. Generally, you enter retranslations when the syntax or exegesis of the adaptation is incorrect or misleading. See <a href="Retranslation.htm">Retranslation</a> for additional information.</p>
