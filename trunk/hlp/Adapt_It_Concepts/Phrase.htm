<h2>Phrase</h2>
<p class="BodyText">A phrase is a <span class="Emphasis">group of words</span> that typically makes sense as a unit. In some cases, adaptation is better done using a phrase rather than word by word so that the same thought appears each time the phrase appears. Decisions about when to use phrases are up to you as the translator. Use your common sense and your understanding of your language to help you decide which phrases would be useful for translation purposes. Short phrases are more useful than long ones since they are more likely to reoccur and so are more likely to be inserted automatically.</p>
