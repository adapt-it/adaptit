<h2>View a note</h2>
<p class="BodyText">You can view any consultant notes, advisor notes, or exegetical notes that you or someone else has created in an Adapt It document. To view a note that was previously created in an Adapt It document, do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">From the current project open the document which has one or more notes you want to view.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The location of each note stored in the document is marked by a pair of icons that look like this: <img src="../../Images/Note_and_Filtered_Icons.gif"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Click on the yellow note icon.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Note</span> dialog opens with the note displayed in the edit box. You can edit it, delete it or locate and view other notes using the buttons at the bottom of the Note dialog. See <a href="Edit_a_note.htm">edit a note</a>, <a href="Delete_a_note.htm">delete a note</a> and <a href="Navigate_through_the_notes_in_a_document.htm">navigate through notes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Click on the <span class="UserInterface">OK</span> button to save any changes you made to the note and to close the dialog. If you click on <span class="UserInterface">Cancel</span> the dialog also closes, but Adapt It does not save any changes you made before closing the dialog.</p>
</li>
</ol>
