<h2>Consistent Changes overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It can perform the task of adapting texts without the aid of any other software; however, it can work with other tools such as Consistent Changes (CC) software. In fact, when you install Adapt It the process installs CC as well. So CC can be used in a restricted way with Adapt It once you have turned it on and have provided the information CC needs. You can find the CC documentation in the <span class="FileName">Adapt It</span> or <span class="FileName">Adapt It Unicode</span> subfolders of your <span class="FileName">Program Files</span> folder.</p>
<p class="BodyText">CC uses one or more tables, each table containing a list of one or more rules to assist in the adaptation process. The rules tell the application how to convert input text in one language to output text in another language. As a simple example, Tok Pisin adds the word "pela" to many of its words. Solomon Island Pijin, a related language, uses the word "fala" in the same way. Therefore, if you are adapting from Tok Pison to Solomon Island Pijin, you can write a CC rule that tells the software replace pela with fala whenever it is encountered. You can use these rules individually to handle a straight forward conversion, or in conjunction with each other to handle more complex situations. A Microsoft Word document called CC.doc in the Adapt It subfolder contains a full discussion of how to use and format CC rules.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you have established one or more CC tables and have turned CC on, Adapt It performs its adaptation in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Checks for the source word or phrase in the knowledge base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If found, places the knowledge base adaptation into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> and proceeds to the next word. The process goes back to step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If not found, processes the word through CC and places the outcome into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Waits for any manual changes you make to the text in the <span class="Strong">Phrase box and for you to press the</span> <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> <span class="Strong">key.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Updates the knowledge base and proceeds to the next word.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="BodyText">Using the CC application, Adapt It can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="Load_consistent_changes.htm">Load Consistent Changes</a></p>

<p class="BodyText">CC can be used with <a href="../Glossing/Glossing.htm">Glossing</a>. It functions in the same way as adaptation, except that the gloss text line rather than the target text line is changed. All changes are stored in the <a href="../../Knowledge_Base/Glossing_knowledge_base.htm">glossing knowledge base</a> rather than the <a href="../../Knowledge_Base/Adaptation_knowledge_base.htm">adaptation knowledge base</a>.</p>
