<h2>Accept changes without stopping</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Accept Changes Without Stopping</span> option of the <span class="UserInterface">Tools</span> menu can only be used if Consistent Changes (CC) has been loaded. See <a href="Load_consistent_changes.htm">Load Consistent Changes</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/Consistent_changes_Section.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">Once you have loaded CC, Adapt It makes the option available.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The purpose of this option is to allow Adapt It and CC to work together to completely adapt a document with little or no human input. In other words, when you choose this option Adapt It runs through the entire adaptation making adaptations in the following priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adaptation for the word or phrase in the knowledge base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The source text word or phrase as possibly changed by the CC rules</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">The only time the adaptation process stops is when the knowledge base contains two or more adaptations for the same word. At that point the translator must choose an adaptation. The process then continues automatically.</p>
<p class="BodyText">This tool is designed for projects where there are only minor differences between the languages and a very strong set of CC rules have been developed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Accept Changes Without Stopping</span> should be only be used when the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The languages are highly related</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The CC rules are very strong in that the consistent changes are regular, well defined and apply to a high proportion of the text to be adapted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The use of CC can introduce a number of incorrect adaptations. Therefore, you need to carefully edit the adaptations after its use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You need to balance the improved speed in adaptation when CC is used against the effort to edit incorrect adaptations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
