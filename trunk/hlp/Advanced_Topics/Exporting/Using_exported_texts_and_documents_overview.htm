<h2>Using exported texts and documents overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">There are three main ways to export texts and documents from Adapt It:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/Export_Source_Text.htm">Export Source Text</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/export_target_text.htm">Export Translation Text</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/Export_Interlinear_Text.htm">Export Interlinear Text</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Source Text exports</h3>
<p class="BodyText">You might wish to export a source text from Adapt It for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to export the source text as a nicely formatted document that Word can print in various semi-publishable forms. First you export the source text as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Rich_text_format.htm">Rich Text Format (RTF)</a> file. Then you open the file in Word for reading and/or printing, optionally attaching the Word Scripture Template to the document (which allows you to make proof printouts, half-page booklets, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You found it necessary to make some changes to the source text using the Edit Source Text command on the Edit menu. You want your changes to be made available for other language adaptation projects that plan to use the same source text, so you export the source text as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Standard_Format_Text_File.htm">Standard format text</a> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You have added a free translation, a back translation, or notes and comments (in the form of <a href="../Notes/Adapt_It_Notes_overview.htm">Adapt It Notes</a>). You want these additional resources to be made available for other language adaptation projects that plan to use the same source text, so you export the source text as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Standard_Format_Text_File.htm">Standard format text</a> file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Translation (Target) Text exports</h3>
<p class="BodyText">You might wish to export a translation (target) text from Adapt It for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to export the translation (target) text as a nicely formatted document that Word can print in various semi-publishable forms. First you export the target text as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Rich_text_format.htm">Rich Text Format (RTF)</a> file. Then you open the file in Word for reading and/or printing, optionally attaching the Word Scripture Template to the document (which allows you to make proof printouts, half-page booklets, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want your translation to be made available for other language adaptation projects that plan to use it as a source text for their adaptation projects, so you export the target text as a <a href="../../Adapt_It_Structure/File_Structure/File_Management/Standard_Format_Text_File.htm">Standard format text</a> file. By default all filtered materials (including back translations, free translations, notes and comments) are automatically propagated along with the target text, and are instantly available for use by the project team using your target text as their source text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to <a href="../Back_Translation/Create_a_separate_back_translation_project.htm">create a separate back translation project</a>. The separate back translation project can then produce interlinear exports that can be given directly to an advisor or consultant for review.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Interlinear Text exports</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Export Interlinear Text</span> command exports your texts in rich text format (RTF) using Word tables. The tables nicely format the navigation text, source text, translation (target) text, and any gloss text, back translation, free translation, and notes/comments, in an easy to read and understand form. You might want to produce such interlinear documents for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to use the interlinear document for linguistic study or presentations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to give the interlinear document to mother tongue speakers to review the translation/adaptation for clarity, accuracy, naturalness and/or acceptability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to give the interlinear document to an advisor or consultant for checking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">You want to give the interlinear document to someone who wants to learn or understand more about the source or target languages represented in the interlinear document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
