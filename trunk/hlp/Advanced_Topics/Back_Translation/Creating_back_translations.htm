<h2>Creating back translations</h2>
<p class="BodyText">There are two main methods for creating <span class="DefinedWord">back translations</span> using Adapt It:</p>
<h3>Gloss line literal back translation</h3>
<p class="BodyText">This method uses Adapt It's <span class="DefinedWord">glossing</span> mode to create a literal word by word back translation shown in the glossing line of the adaptation. See <a href="Create_a_gloss_line_literal_back_translation.htm">Create a gloss line literal back translation</a>. Some considerations about the process include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">An advantage of this process is that the original source text, the adapted target text and the back translation text (in the gloss text) are all visible in a single document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">An disadvantage of this method is that glossing mode cannot be used to merge words into phrases, do <span class="DefinedWord">retranslations</span>, or insert <span class="DefinedWord">placeholders</span>. As a result, the gloss line back translation may not be clear enough for a translation consultant to use effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate back translation project</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The second method is to create a new project specifically for the back translations. See <a href="Create_a_separate_back_translation_project.htm">Create a separate back translation project</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">In this method, you create a new adaptation project to do the work of back translating. For each document in the back translation project, you <a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/Doc_Mngment/export_target_text.htm">export the target text</a> from original adaptation project. Then, you use the exported text as <span class="DefinedWord">source text</span> in the back translation project. You can then adapt the new source text into a back translation using.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">This method has the advantage that the back translator can use all of Adapt It's features including inserting <span class="DefinedWord">placeholders</span>, <span class="DefinedWord">merging source text words</span> into phrases, <span class="DefinedWord">retranslating passages,</span> and creating <span class="DefinedWord">free translations</span> to make the meaning clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">A disadvantage of this method is the effort necessary to coordinate between the two projects -- the original adaptation project and the back translation project. In addition, the original source in the adaptation project is not included in the back translation project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">Once a back translation is created using one of the two methods described above, Adapt It has advanced features that can collect those back translations into the current project as <a href="../Filtering/Filtering_of_information.htm">filtered information</a><span class="DefinedWord">.</span> You can then propagate or pass along this information to other related language or cluster language projects. See <a href="Collecting_filtered_back_translations.htm">Collecting filtered back translations</a>.</p>

<li>
<p class="BodyText">You can also you use <a href="../Free_Translation/Free_translation_overview.htm">free translations</a> to assist the translation consultant if the back translation produced by either of the above methods does not provide sufficient information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
