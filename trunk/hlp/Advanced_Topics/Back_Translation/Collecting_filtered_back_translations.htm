<h2>Collecting filtered back translations</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It can store back translations inside its documents and manage them in the form of . Filtered material such as back translations are stored in the background and can only be seen by clicking on a green wedge<img src="../../Images/Green_wedge.GIF">. See <a href="../Filtering/View_Filtered_Material.htm">View filtered material</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Use the <span class="UserInterface">Collect Back Translations…</span> command on the <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span> menu to incorporate back translations into the Adapt It document. You can use this option to do any one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Collect the current adaptation information as a back translation. In other words, copy the target text into the filtered back translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Collect the current gloss information as a back translation. In other words, copy the gloss test into the filtered back translations. You may have created these glosses directly or transformed them from another project. See <a href="../Glossing/Transform_adaptations_into_glosses.htm">Transform adaptations into glosses</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Create empty back translation placeholders throughout a document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">For more information see <a href="Collect_back_translations.htm">Collect back translations</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Once you have incorporated a back translation into an Adapt It document, you can <a href="Viewing_and_editing_filtered_back_translations.htm">view and edit it</a>. Also, when you export translation (target) texts, Adapt It exports the back translations as well. This process is called propagation. Thus, if you use the translation text as the source text in another project, the back translation is already available. See <a href="../Filtering/Propagation_of_filtered_information.htm">Propagation of filtered information</a>.</p>
