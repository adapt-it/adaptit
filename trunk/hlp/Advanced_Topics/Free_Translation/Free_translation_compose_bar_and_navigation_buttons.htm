<h2>Free translation compose bar and navigation buttons</h2>
<p class="BodyText">While Adapt It is in Free Translation Mode, the following compose bar and navigation buttons are visible at the top of the main window.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/Free_Trans_compose_bar_gen.PNG"></p>
<h3>Typing Free Translations</h3>
<p class="BodyText">Enter your free translation for the current section in the edit box of the compose bar. It can be as long as you like, but if it is so long that it cannot fit within the document&#39;s layout of the words to which it applies, then Adapt It will lay out as much of it as can fit, and put an ellipsis (...) at the end to indicate there is more to be seen. To view the unseen part, you only need to make the section with the ellipsis be the current section, and the whole free translation will be in the Compose Bar&#39;s edit box, and you can scroll it as necessary to read it all.</p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p class="BodyText">The buttons are available to help you to define sections of text to be free translated, to move about among the defined sections, and to adjust the length of sections. Some of the buttons may be disabled (grayed out) if Adapt It figures out that using the button would be inappropriate. See <a href="Using_the_Free_translation_compose_bar_buttons.htm">Using the Free translation compose bar buttons</a> for more information.</p>
<h4><img src="../../warning_icon.gif">&nbsp;Warning</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Do not turn off the free translation mode until the contents of the compose bar's box are saved by moving to a new section using <span class="UserInterface">Next&gt;</span> or <span class="UserInterface">&lt;Prev</span>. Otherwise, the contents of the box will be lost and you must reenter the text.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img src="../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If you click in an existing free translation with a green background, that section becomes the current one. Its text is shown in the compose bar&#39;s box, and the background changes to pink.</p>
</li>
</ul>
