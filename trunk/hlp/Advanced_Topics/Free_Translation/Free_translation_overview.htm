<h2>Free translation overview</h2>
<p class="BodyText">A free translation is an idiomatic translation of an adapted <span class="DefinedWord">target text.</span> The language used is usually a language known by a translation consultant. A free translation is normally done late in the adaptation process after most corrections and revisions have been made, and before submitting the translation to the consultant for checking. The free translation is often used to supplement a <span class="DefinedWord">back translation</span> enabling the consultant to better understand the meaning of the target text and help validate its quality. A free translation is generally more freely or idiomatically translated (less literal) than a back translation, and does not necessarily follow the grammatical patterns of the target text from which it is made. Like back translation, a person who creates a free translation needs to know both the <span class="DefinedWord">target language</span> and a language known by a translation consultant. The consultant can then use the free translation, usually along with a back translation, comparing both to the original text. If the essential meaning of the text is unchanged, the translation processes has been successful.</p>
