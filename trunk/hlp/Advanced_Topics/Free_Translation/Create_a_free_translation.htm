<h2>Create a free translation</h2>
<p class="BodyText">To create a free translation for an adapted text, do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">From the current project open a document that has already been adapted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">On the <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span> menu click <span class="UserInterface">Free Translation Mode</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Free Translation Compose</span> bar and its navigation buttons appear at the top of the <span class="UserInterface">Main window</span>.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/Free_Trans_compose_bar_gen.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It highlights a section of the adaptation.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/Free_trans_sample.PNG"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Decide whether you want Adapt It to define free translations sections by punctuation or by verses divisions. If you want free translation sections defined by punctuation select the <span class="UserInterface">Punctuation</span> button. If you want free translation sections defined by verse divisions select the <span class="UserInterface">Verse</span> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If the span of target text that Adapt It highlighted in pink is suitable for the first segment of free translation, continue with step 5 below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Use the <span class="UserInterface">Shorten</span> button or <span class="UserInterface">Lengthen</span> button to shorten or lengthen the section to an appropriate length. You can shorten to as short as a single word. You can lengthen as long as you like, or until you encounter a significant standard format marker. The <span class="Strong">pink</span> highlighted area shows the extent of the section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Type the free translation in the compose bar&#39;s edit box for the current section. The current section is always highlighted in <span class="Strong">pink</span> and has the phrase box located at its first pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Proceed through the text using the navigation buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Next&gt;</span> moves forward one section</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">&lt;Prev</span> moves backwards one section</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UserInterface">Advance</span> finds a new empty place for a free translation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Type the free translations in the compose bar&#39;s edit box for each section of the text until the whole text is sectioned with free translations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Turn off free translation mode by clicking the <span class="UserInterface">Free Translation Mode</span> option in the <span class="UserInterface">Advanced</span> menu.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The free translation in the <span class="UserInterface">Compose bar&#39;s</span> text box can be as long as you like, but the entire text may no be visible in the layout of the words to which it applies. Adapt It displays as much as can fit, and then puts an ellipsis (…) at the end to indicate there is more to be seen. To view the unseen part, move to that section. The whole free translation appears in the compose Bar&#39;s edit box. You can scroll it as necessary to read it all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Free translations are always available for viewing even if free translation mode is turned off. Just click on the green wedge where you want to see the free translation and select the <span class="Strong">\free</span> marker. You can edit the text in the View Filtered Material dialog. Even while free translation mode is on, you can click any other visible green wedge icon and edit the filtered information at that location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It provides a convenient way to build a first approximation of a free translation automatically by using either the target text or the gloss text. You can then edit the results for a better free translation. See <a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/Advanced_Menu/Using_a_default_free_translation.htm">Using a default free translation</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">When <span class="UserInterface">Verse</span> is selected, free translation occurs for the whole verse. However, if there are significant <span class="DefinedWord">standard format markers</span> (e.g. \l, \q) within the verse, the free translation stops at that marker. The next free translation section starts at the next word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">As the <span class="DefinedWord">phrase box</span> moves the sections, it is always placed at the beginning <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span> of the current section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="DefinedWord">target text</span> in the phrase box cannot be edited in free translation mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="Strong">Green</span> highlighting is used to show you which words have existing free translations defined on them. <span class="Strong">White</span> is used to show you which words are not yet free translated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Each character of the current free translation appears under the <span class="DefinedWord">strip</span> as you enter it into the <span class="UserInterface">Compose bar's</span> text box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img src="../../warning_icon.gif">&nbsp;Warning</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Under some conditions, Adapt It move the source text into the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> and the current adaptation may be overwritten. Be sure that you have not introduced an error into the text. This usually occurs in the first adaptation of the phrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
