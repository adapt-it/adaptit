<h2>Using the Free translation compose bar buttons</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="UserInterface">Free translation compose bar</span> buttons control the process of creating free translations.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><img src="../../Images/Free_Trans_Compose_Bar_Buttons.PNG"></p>
<p class="BodyText">The buttons are available to help you to define sections of text to be free translated, to move about among the defined sections, and to adjust the length of sections. Some of the buttons may be disabled (grayed out) if Adapt It figures out that using the button would be inappropriate.</p>
<h4>Punctuation (option button) - default</h4>
<p class="BodyText">When this button is selected, Adapt It breaks the target text into sections based on where it encounters significant punctuation (for example, full stop, colon or semi-colon). However, if it encounters a significant standard format marker (for example, \q or \p) before it encounters such punctuation, the existing section is closed off at the marker and the next section starts at the next word.</p>
<h4>Verse (option button)</h4>
<p class="BodyText">When this button is selected Adapt It breaks the target text into sections on a verse by verse basis. However, if it encounters a significant standard format marker (for example, \q or \p) within the verse, the section is closed off at the marker and the next section starts at the next word.</p>
<h4>Shorten</h4>
<p class="BodyText">This button allows you to shorten the selection by one word for each click of the button. You can shorten a section to as short as a single word.</p>
<h4>Lengthen</h4>
<p class="BodyText">You can use this button (when enabled) to lengthen the selection by one word for each click of the button. You can lengthen a section as long as you like, or until you encounter a significant standard format marker.</p>
<h4>&lt;Prev</h4>
<p class="BodyText">When this button is enabled you may use it to move to the <span class="Strong">previous</span> section of free translation. If you use the button more than once without entering any words into the text box, Adapt It considers the skipped section to be an empty free translation and uses an olive wedge shape icon<img src="../../Images/olive_wedge.GIF"> to mark the section.</p>
<h4>Next&gt;</h4>
<p class="BodyText">When this button is enabled you may use it to move to the <span class="Strong">next</span> section of free translation. If you use the button more than once without entering any words into the text box, Adapt It considers the skipped section to be an empty free translation and uses an olive wedge shape icon<img src="../../Images/olive_wedge.GIF"> to mark the section.</p>
<h4>Remove</h4>
<p class="BodyText">You may use this button to remove the current free translation section. What you do next determines the final result. If you press <span class="UserInterface">&lt;Prev</span> or <span class="UserInterface">Next&gt;</span> the free translation section is totally removed. In other words the free translation, the standard format markers, and the wedge icons disappear. When you remove a section and then <span class="UserInterface">Advance</span>, you have an empty free translation. In other words, you have a free translation but it just doesn’t have any words in it. Adapt It uses an olive wedge shaped icon<img src="../../Images/olive_wedge.GIF"> to show that the section is empty.</p>
<h4>Advance</h4>
<p class="BodyText">You may use this button to find a new empty space to start a new free translation. When you click on this button, Adapt It moves the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> forward in the document until it finds a section that is not marked as a free translation. It skips over all sections marked as free translations or empty free translations.</p>
<h4><img src="../../Note_Icon.gif">&nbsp;Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">When you enter a free translation, the <span class="UserInterface">Phrase box</span> anchors the translation at the first <span class="DefinedWord">pile</span> of the section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">To quickly edit a free translation section in the document, click on the green wedge icon<img src="../../Images/Green_wedge.GIF"> at the start of the section. You can do this for any icon. The <a href="../Filtering/Viewing_and_Editing_Filtered_Material.htm">View Filtered Material dialog</a> appears. You can then edit the material in the dialog. The USFM marker is <span class="UserInterface">\free</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If there is no free translation immediately ahead of the current location, the <span class="UserInterface">Next&gt;</span> and <span class="UserInterface">Advance</span> buttons work identically. That is they find both find the next unmarked section.</p>
