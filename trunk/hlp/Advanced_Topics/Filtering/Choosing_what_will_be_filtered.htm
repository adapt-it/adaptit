<h2>Choosing what will be filtered</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It can filter or hide several types of information. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../Back_Translation/Back_translation_overview.htm">Back translations</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../Free_Translation/Free_translation_overview.htm">Free translations</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText"><a href="../Notes/Adapt_It_Notes_overview.htm">Adapt It Notes</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">These filtered materials cannot be seen as part of the adaptation. To view them, you need to click on a green wedge shaped icon<img src="../../Images/Green_wedge.GIF">. See <a href="Viewing_and_Editing_Filtered_Material.htm">View and editing filtered material</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Other types of information can be seen as part of the adaptation. These include items such as headings, introductions, glossaries and back matter. Adapt It does not normally work directly with many of these, but they can appear in the adaptation unless filtered out. You need to decide what material you want to see while doing your adaptation. See <a href="Set_filtering_preferences.htm">Set filtering preferences</a> for information about including or excluding material from the adaptation.</p>
