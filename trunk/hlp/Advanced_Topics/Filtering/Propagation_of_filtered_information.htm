<h2>Propagation of filtered information</h2>
<p class="BodyText">Adapt It&#39;s ability to <span class="DefinedWord">propagate</span> filtered information from project to project makes it a powerful tool for saving time and effort in related language and cluster language projects. Within Adapt It, back translations, free translations, and Adapt It notes are always filtered or hidden in the background meaning they are not seen during the adaptation process. However they can be viewed and edited as needed.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Whenever you use Adapt It to export a document's target text, by default Adapt It also <span class="Strong">propagates</span> or passes along all filtered material as well. Thus, when you export the target text as a standard format text file, the output files contain both the target and the filtered material. If you then input these standard format text files into a new project, Adapt It imports both the translated text and the filtered material. We say that it has been propagated to the new project. The filtered material is stored along with the text as is now available for use in the new project and does not have to be built from scratch.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To prevent the propagation of filtered material you must intentionally tell Adapt It not to export specific filtered material by using the <a href="../Exporting/Export_filter_options.htm">Export Filter/Options</a> dialog.</p>
<h3>Advantages of propagating material</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Back translations, free translations, consultant or advisor notes, and other filtered items do not have to be recreated from scratch, and are instantly and easily available for viewing and modification for each new project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The translator can view the propagated back translations, free translations, and consultant or advisor notes from the original project. This capability can provide helpful information to the translator in the current project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Since back translations and free translations for related language projects and cluster language projects are often very similar, only a small amount of editing may be necessary to make them reflect any differences in the current target text. Thus, propagation can save a lot of time and effort if used with care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The danger of propagating back translations and free translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">If adjustments are <span class="Strong">not</span> made to the back translations and free translation to make them reflect the meaning of the current target text, they may not accurately reflect its meaning and mislead the consultant and others who rely on them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
