<h2>Packing and unpacking documents</h2>
<p class="BodyText">The process of Packing and Unpacking documents is an Adapt It feature that assists translators to share their work. When you a pack a document Adapt It prepares a special compressed file with the file extension <span class="FileName">aip</span> (Adapt It Packed). By copying this to another computer, you or another translator can easily recreate the original document in another location. Any form of movable media can be used to transfer a file from the original compute to the destination computer, as long as the hardware is compatible to both computers. Email attachments can be used as well.</p>
<p class="BodyText">When Adapt It packs a document, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The <span class="FileName">XML</span> form of the document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">The project&#39;s configuration file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BodyText">Additional information needed to set up the document on the destination computer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">You can pack or unpack only one file at a time. However, you can send many individual files to the destination computer. Each of the files can then be unpacked one by one. Once you have transferred all of the documents, you can use <a href="../../User_Interface/Menu_Bar/File_Menu/KB_Mngment/Restore_the_knowledge_base.htm">Restore the knowledge base</a> in the <span class="UserInterface">File</span> menu to build a new knowledge base.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You can pack and send documents from different projects. When each document is unpacked on the destination machine, Adapt It determines whether or not the project is already on the destination machine. If the project exists, Adapt It puts it there. If not, Adapt It creates a new project folder to receive it.</p>
