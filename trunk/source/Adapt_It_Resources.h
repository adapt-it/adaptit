// Design Notes:
// The ID number defines and function declarations for nearly all
// of wxWidgets Adapt It are automatically generated by wxDesigner 
// and are located in the wxDesigner generated Adapt_It_wdr.h file 
// which is #included below. Therefore, each time wxDesigner is 
// used to add or change any Dialog, Menubar, Toolbar, Controlbar, 
// Composebar, or Bitmap creation function, the contents of the 
// Adapt_It_wdr.h and Adapt_It_wdr.cpp files will change. Those 
// changes will be automatically incorporated into the code base
// via the following #include:
/////////////// The wxDesigner Generated resources ///////////
#include "Adapt_It_wdr.h"
/////////////// The wxDesigner Generated resources ///////////

/////////////// String Table Resources for Translation ////////////
/* 
// The string table resources listed below are all in one place to be 
// handy during development since they show up in a "find in files" 
// search by their ID label. They are copied from the MFC Adapt_It.rc 
// file.
