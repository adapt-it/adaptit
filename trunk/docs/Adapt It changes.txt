Version 4.1.0 update 31Jan2009:

* Sil Converters is now implemented in the Windows port. SIL Converters must first be installed on the computer to enable Adapt It's Tools Menu and Advanced Menu items related to SIL Converters. See SIL Converters documentation for more information.
* Fixes the problem of pegging the CPU usage at near 100% while Adapt It WX is running. Now Adapt It WX should use less that 1% when the application is running but it is sitting in an idle state.
* Fixes a problem in which the View Filtered Material dialog would not size properly if the list of standard format markers had many markers in it.
* Fixes a possible spurious error message that can appear when the WX version reads a legacy project configuration file and the user sets up Auto Capitalization in the Case page of the Preferences dialog.
* Fixes incorrect double-click behavior of the "Translations..." listbox in the Choose Translation dialog. Before the fix a double-click might result in the wrong list item being entered, or the dialog closing with nothing happening.
* Fixes incorrect behavior of the "Accept <no adaptation> for this item" button and the "Ignore it, I will fix it later" button in the "Inconsistency Found" dialog which can pop up in the event of an inconsistency during a Consistency Check... selection (from the Edit menu). The bug was causing these two buttons to be the same as pressing the dialog's "Cancel" button.
* The Go To... dialog and many other dialogs now default to the OK button when the user presses Enter.
* The Knowledge Base Editor now automatically looks up the source phrase at the current location of the phrase box, unless the user has selected a different source phrase at another location in the text at the time the Knowledge Base Editor is invoked. Note: The Knowledge base editor will not show a source phrase entry in its lists if the source phrase reference count was only 1 before the phrase box is placed at that location. To see a source phrase, whose reference count was 1, you need to move the phrase box to a different location before invoking the Knowledge Base Editor. Caution: If you use the Restore Knowledge Base... option on the File menu, beware that it resets all reference counts back to 1, and you will not be able to look up any source phrase entries in the Knowledge Base Editor while the phrase box is located at source phrases whose reference count has not subsequently increased to a value greater than one.
* Fixes a bug in vertical editing that resulted in the Choose Translation dialog appearing twice, the first time with none of the controls initialized, the second time with initialization done twice and so the list box had the entries doubled.
* Fixes the following bug: in vertical edit, with glosses being done before adaptations, the phrase box was not programmatically returned to the start of the editable span in the adaptations line.

Version 4.0.4 update 13Dec2008:

* Better detection of the default documents working directory's actual location. For example, if on a Windows system, the user has "moved" the location of the "My Documents" folder (on Windows XP) or the "Documents" folder (on Vista), by right clicking on the default folder, selecting "Properties" and the "Move..." button and selects a new "destination" for "My Documents" (or "Documents"), this version should detect more acurately the change of location for these system folders, and establish/look for its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder in that new location.
* Fixes a long-standing bug in the Mac version that prevented scrolling from working correctly. This bug fix will allow the Mac port to move forward toward a release in early 2009.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.3 update 26Nov2008:

* About dialog now displays the date of the current release as well as the current version number.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.2 update 22Nov2008:

* Source Text Editing ("vertical editing") is more fully implemented and should be more robust.
* Fixes a program hang that would happen if the computer's system language was set to something other than English and not a language that has an existing localization. This was reported by a user whose system language was set to Dutch, and the Default choice in the Choose Interface Language... dialog wrongly showed Dutch as the default first choice. But Dutch does not infact exist as an interface language choice, so the program encountered problems resulting in a program hang.
* Fixes a number of problems that can occur if a project configuration file refers to a font name that does not exist on the current local machine (which might happen when migrating data to a different computer or platform). When the configuration file is read in, Adapt It will substitute a system font for any unknown font referred to in the project configuration file and notify the user of the action taken. The user would then need to insure that the appropriate font was installed, and/or select the appropriate font from the Fonts tab of the Preferences... dialog from the Edit menu.
* Fixes the bottleneck that was causing the KBEditor to take too much time to populate the key string list box when there are many hundreds or thousands of entries in the list box.
* Updates the AI_USFM.xml style control file to reflect the new USFM 2.2 changes made by UBS on 17Oct2008.

Version 4.0.1 update 28Oct2008:

* Fixes a potential crash problem in the source text editing's vertical edit process. 
* Adds sanity checks to insure that valid selections are made in a number of list box controls. 
* Makes adjustments to the sizers in a number of the larger dialogs and the wizard to better fit on the smaller 800 x 600 pixel screens being used on the new generation of mini notebook computers. 
* Updates the documentation for version 4. 
* Makes a few changes to the localization files. This is the first version advertised to the user community.

New WX Version 4.0.0 initial release 16Oct2008:

Adapt It WX is an entirely new version of Adapt It based on the wxWidgets Cross-Platform GUI Library. This new version of Adapt It is no longer dependent on Microsoft's MFC programming framework, nor does it utilize the .NET Framework, but is now independent of Microsoft's proprietary technologies in order to become a truly cross-platform application. See the "Known Issues and Limitations.txt" file for information on how this cross-platform version differs from previous legacy versions.

(See the legacy version 3.6.4 for changes prior to this new release of Adapt It WX)
