Version 4.1.6 update 30Jun2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.6
----------------------------------------------
* Adapt It now can process an -wf <path> command-line option, 
where <path> is the path to a folder to be used as Adapt It's
work folder. When this command-line option is used the <path>
will be used instead of Adapt It's default work folder which
has traditionally been called "Adapt It (Unicode) Work". The 
<path> following the -wf option can be on a different drive/
volume or even a network path. This option can be added to 
the command-line on most systems by right-clicking on a menu 
item, shortcut, or launcher icon that is normally used to start 
Adapt It, and choosing "Properties" from the popup menu. Find 
the Command or Target field that invokes Adapt It, and add a 
space followed by the -xo followed by another space and the
desired path. For example, the Command/Target field might look
like this (on a Windows Start Menu item for Adapt It WX):

"C:\Program Files\Adapt It WX\Adapt_It.exe" -wf "e:\My Data"

in which case the project file(s) created by Adapt It would
be located in the "My Data" folder on the e: drive volume.
Note: paths containing spaces must be enclosed in quote marks.
If no -wf <path> command-line argument is supplied Adapt It 
reverts completely back to its classic behavior of creating 
an "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder in the user's 
"(My) Documents" folder (or whatever path and folder name 
the OS reports is currently being used for documents by the 
user), and using that folder as its work folder.

If an administrator sets Adapt It up to use a custom work 
folder (using -wf <path>) AFTER data is already created at 
the default "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder location, 
Adapt It currently simply doesn't find the previously 
existing classic work folder, and will instead create/use 
what is specified in the -wf <path> command-line option. An 
administrator who sets up the custom work folder can at the 
same time, copy or move all of the projects from a previously 
existing "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder to the new custom 
work folder and Adapt It will just "see" them there at the 
custom specified <path> and all other previous program 
behaviors do not change.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.6
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug that might prevent a font color change from
being registered correctly.

Version 4.1.5 update 31May2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.5
----------------------------------------------
* A user can now edit the source text word/phrase at the
current location of the phrasebox without having to select
the source text word/phrase at that location. This
provides a more convenient way to change the spelling of
a source text word/phrase when the phrasebox is at that
location. Editing the source text in this manner can be
initiated via the Ctrl+Q hot key (Command-Shift-E on the 
Mac), or via the Edit Source Text... selection on the Edit
menu.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.5
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed the behavior of the View Filtered Material dialog 
so that it now allows editing of the text associated with
the marker that is selected. The dialog also closes when 
the user presses the Enter key, effectively pressing the
"Save Changes" button.
* Fixed the behavior of the Edit Source Text dialog so that
it now closes when the user presses the Enter key instead of
entering a newline in the dialog's edit box.
* Fixed some memory leaks in the Edit Source Text routines.
* Fixed a bug that was causing the application to think that 
punctuation had changed whenever the user clicked on the OK 
button of the Preferences dialog. The unnecessary processing 
of the document for punctuation changes could cause a 
noticeable delay after clicking OK in the Preferences dialog
in long documents.
* The automatic scrolling that Adapt It does during 
adaptation work should now do a better job of keeping the 
phrasebox within view.
* Using ALT+TAB on Windows to change between running 
applications should now display the Adapt It icon in the list 
of icon choices.

Version 4.1.4 update 29Apr2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.4
----------------------------------------------
* Adapt It now can process an -xo command-line option. The -xo 
command-line option was specifically designed to make Adapt It's 
interface work better on an OLPC XO machine running the BALSA 
distribution of Ubuntu Linux (Intrepid). The -xo option causes 
Adapt It to use a toolbar with larger (but fewer) buttons; a mode 
bar that spans two lines instead of a single line under the 
toolbar; and a few dialogs adjusted for better layout. The -xo 
option is not restricted to use on the OLPC XO; it can be added 
to the command-line on most systems by right-clicking on a menu 
item, shortcut, or launcher icon that is normally used to start 
Adapt It, and choosing "Properties" from the popup menu. Find 
the Command or Target field that invokes Adapt It, and add a 
space followed by the -xo option to the launching command.
* Updates the AI_USFM.xml USFM/style control file to coordinate 
with UBS USFM 2.208.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.4
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug that was displaying the wrong target phrase 
(usually a previous one) when the "Place medial punctuation" 
dialog appears during adaptation.
* Fixed a bug that was allowing final punctuation to enter the 
Knowledgebase and be stored in adapted documents. If a user's 
current knowledge base has wrongly admitted items with 
punctuation into fields that should not contain punctuation, 
the user can fix the problem by doing the following: 
   (1) run Adapt It, 
   (2) Choose the project but cancel out at the Document page 
       of the wizard so that no document is opened (or select 
       File > Close if a document was opened), and 
   (3) run the File > Restore Knowledgebase... command, 
       selecting all documents that should be used for 
       rebuilding the KB.
   (4) If Restore Knowledgebase... command discovered any 
       wrongly stored punctuation in the KB and adaptation 
       documents, the user is notified and an error log called 
       KBRestoreErrorLog.txt is saved in the project folder.
The rebuilt KB will no longer contain any final punctuation. 
If any of the documents used to restore the KB contained 
incorrectly stored punctuation, that punctuation is removed 
from the appropriate fields of those documents and the 
documents are re-saved. 
* Adapt It's position and size on the desktop is now 
preserved more consistently, between sessions. Also, if 
Adapt It's frame was maximized on last use, it starts the new 
session maximized, even when last used on a desktop spread 
across a second monitor with Adapt It on either monitor.
* Changed the Adapt It Help Topics to display the 
"Using Adapt It" HTML page as its starting page instead of 
the Glossary page. Also fixed a number of reported dead links 
in the HTML Help files.

Mac version:
* Fixed a number of issues in the new Mac version. Note: 
Although the Mac version is newly released, its version 
numbers are assigned to be concurrent with the version 
numbers for Windows and Linux versions.

Linux version:
* Adapt It can now be configured for a better layout of its 
interface when running on a computer with high dpi 
resolution screen (like the OLPC XO). When Adapt It is 
invoked with the -xo command-line option, Adapt It 
substitutes a toolbar with double sized buttons/images, and 
spreads the check box and other items in the mode bar over 
two rows of controls so they won't disappear off the right 
end of the main window. Some other dialogs have also been 
adjusted to layout better on these high dpi resolution 
screens.

Version 4.1.2 update 24Mar2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.2
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a crash in the Linux version that could happen 
when a text was adapted fully to the end of the document. 
The message "The End. Providing..." would appear to flicker 
and then a few seconds afterward the application would 
hang/crash (or the crash might happen if the Step Up 
button was clicked while at the end of the document).
* Fixed the action of the checkbox in the Case tab of the 
Preferences dialog that reads "Check here if you want 
Adapt It to automatically distinguish between upper case 
and lower case letters". Previously checking this checkbox 
might fail to take effect until the second time it was 
checked.
* Also adjusted the problem of the Case tab in Preferences 
not sizing properly when the list boxes have data in them 
(hiding some buttons at bottom).
* Fixed Ctrl+O hot key on Linux version, and assigned 
Ctrl+Shift+O hot key to invoke Start Working... wizard on 
Linux version.
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.2
----------------------------------------------
* Added Menu short cut keys for the Advanced and Layout 
menus.
* Focus now moves to the New Translation edit box of the 
Choose Translation dialog if the last Translation in the 
list box is removed.
* Navigation text now displays "end fn" to mark the last 
source word of a footnote.

Version 4.1.1 update 28Feb2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.1
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in the KB Editor that was causing a program 
crash when removing an existing translation string from 
the list of translations for a given source phrase.
* Changed the layout of buttons in some dialogs to allow 
configuration of OK and Cancel buttons to reverse their 
relative positions as required for the Mac port. This 
change has minimal impact on the Windows and Linux 
versions.
* Choose Translation dialog now has a short-cut key for 
jumping to the "New Translation" edit box, and implements 
cyclical up/down arrow key selection (for Windows and 
Mac - Linux implementation is only partial)
* Macintosh pre-release version: Fixes a number of Mac 
look-and-feel issues and source text selection issues.

Version 4.1.0 update 31Jan2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* Sil Converters is now implemented in the Windows port. 
SIL Converters must first be installed on the computer to 
enable Adapt It's Tools Menu and Advanced Menu items 
related to SIL Converters. See SIL Converters 
documentation for more information.
* The TU elements in the Knowledge Base XML files are now 
sorted. Some users requested this change to make 
Subversion backups more efficient.
* The Knowledge Base Editor now shows only the "All Gloss 
Words Or Phrases" tab while Glossing is active.
* Previously, the Knowledge Base Editor would not show a 
source phrase entry in its lists if the source phrase 
reference count was only 1 before the phrase box is 
placed at that location. In such cases, to examine a 
source phrase whose reference count was 1, the user had to 
first move the phrase box to a different location and 
select the source word/phrase desired for lookup, before 
invoking the KB Editor. Now, the source phrase appearing 
in the phrase box will be looked up, and found in the KB 
Editor even if its reference count was 1 before the KB 
Editor was invoked.
* The Knowledge Base Editor now automatically looks up 
the source phrase at the current location of the phrase 
box, unless the user has selected a different source 
phrase at another location in the text at the time the 
Knowledge Base Editor is invoked.
* The "Check Knowledge Base" selection was removed from 
the File menu. It was not really needed and only served 
to make project loading take longer.
* Added "Please wait..." dialog for project loading at 
the project page. The saving of KBs was optimized for 
speed resulting in shorter wait times when opening a 
project with very large KBs.
* Change the Restore Knowledge Base functionality so 
that it avoids trying to set the adaptations to their 
punctuation-containing forms. This prevents any 
punctuation-placement dialogs from opening during the 
restore operation - a useful thing to do because such 
dialogs have no useful purpose during restoration of 
the knowledge base.
* In the event of an error loading an XML adaptation 
document, the name of the file being loaded now appears 
in the title bar of the message box.
* The Adapt It Reference.doc includes a more complete 
description of the enhanced Edit Source Text process 
and Adapt It's "vertical editing" process that assists 
in the process.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* The Go To... dialog and many other dialogs now 
default to the OK button when the user presses Enter.
* Fixes the problem of pegging the CPU usage at near 
100% while Adapt It is running. Now Adapt It should 
use less than 1% when the application is running but 
sitting in an idle state.
* Fixes a problem in which the View Filtered Material 
dialog would not size properly if the list of 
standard format markers had many markers in it.
* Fixes a possible spurious error message that can 
appear when the WX version reads a legacy project 
configuration file and the user sets up Auto 
Capitalization in the Case page of the Preferences 
dialog.
* Fixes incorrect double-click behavior of the 
"Translations..." listbox in the Choose Translation 
dialog. Before the fix a double-click might result in 
the wrong list item being entered, or the dialog 
closing with nothing happening.
* Fixes incorrect behavior of the "Accept 
<no adaptation> for this item" button and the "Ignore 
it, I will fix it later" button in the "Inconsistency 
Found" dialog which can pop up in the event of an 
inconsistency during a Consistency Check... selection 
(from the Edit menu). The bug was causing these two 
buttons to be the same as pressing the dialog's "Cancel" 
button.
* Fixes a bug in vertical editing that resulted in the 
Choose Translation dialog appearing twice, the first 
time with none of the controls initialized, the second 
time with initialization done twice and so the list 
box had the entries doubled.
* Fixes the following bug: in vertical edit, with 
glosses being done before adaptations, the phrase box 
was not programmatically returned to the start of the 
editable span in the adaptations line.
* Ubuntu Intrepid: Fixed the program hang/crash 
problem that occurred when opening the Help Topics 
item on the Help menu in the Linux port under Ubuntu 
Intrepid.
* Fixed another bug in the Knowledge Base Editor where 
look ups of source phrases composed of two or more 
merged words could sometimes result in duplicate 
entries in the Source Phrase list box.
* Fixes a bug in opening the Knowledge Base Editor 
from a source text selection, the item highlighted in 
the dialog's Source Phrase list might turn out to be 
the first item in the list, rather than the one the 
user selected in the main window.
* Fixes the following bug: if the user inserted a 
placeholder before a word or phrase where standard 
format markers were stored, and later did a source text 
standard format export, then the SF markers at that 
location would not be included in the exported data.
* Fixes a bug in the KB Export function that failed to 
insert end-of-line characters into the exported KB file 
(Unicode version only - the ANSI version did not have 
the problem).
* Fixes the following bug: if the user selected source 
text which begins with an SF marker, such as \q for 
'poetry', and in the Edit Source Text dialog removes 
all the selection but just leaves the \q marker in the 
box, the final result is that there is a white space 
gap in the text where the marker is stored (an 
underlying storage element with no content except the 
marker). What the user expects is that the marker will 
attach to the first word following the former selection 
- and that is now what happens.
* Fixes the following bug introduced at version 4: if 
the source text contained two or more words in a merger 
and there was punctuation medially within the phrase, 
if the user did a File / Restore Knowledge Base 
operation, when the Place Phrase-Medial Punctuation 
dialog came up, the target text shown in the dialog was 
not the correct text, it was just whatever contents the 
phrase box had when the restore operation was invoked.

Version 4.0.4 update 13Dec2008:

* Better detection of the default documents working 
directory's actual location. For example, if on a Windows 
system, the user has "moved" the location of the 
"My Documents" folder (on Windows XP) or the "Documents" 
folder (on Vista), by right clicking on the default folder, 
selecting "Properties" and the "Move..." button and selects 
a new "destination" for "My Documents" (or "Documents"), 
this version should detect more acurately the change of 
location for these system folders, and establish/look for 
its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder in that new location.
* Fixes a long-standing bug in the Mac version that 
prevented scrolling from working correctly. This bug fix 
will allow the Mac port to move forward toward a release 
in early 2009.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.3 update 26Nov2008:

* About dialog now displays the date of the current release 
as well as the current version number.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.2 update 22Nov2008:

* Source Text Editing ("vertical editing") is more fully 
implemented and should be more robust.
* Fixes a program hang that would happen if the computer's 
system language was set to something other than English and 
not a language that has an existing localization. This was 
reported by a user whose system language was set to Dutch, 
and the Default choice in the Choose Interface Language... 
dialog wrongly showed Dutch as the default first choice. 
But Dutch does not infact exist as an interface language 
choice, so the program encountered problems resulting in a 
program hang.
* Fixes a number of problems that can occur if a project 
configuration file refers to a font name that does not 
exist on the current local machine (which might happen when 
migrating data to a different computer or platform). When 
the configuration file is read in, Adapt It will substitute 
a system font for any unknown font referred to in the 
project configuration file and notify the user of the 
action taken. The user would then need to insure that the 
appropriate font was installed, and/or select the 
appropriate font from the Fonts tab of the Preferences... 
dialog from the Edit menu.
* Fixes the bottleneck that was causing the KBEditor to 
take too much time to populate the key string list box 
when there are many hundreds or thousands of entries in 
the list box.
* Updates the AI_USFM.xml style control file to reflect 
the new USFM 2.2 changes made by UBS on 17Oct2008.

Version 4.0.1 update 28Oct2008:

* Fixes a potential crash problem in the source text 
editing's vertical edit process. 
* Adds sanity checks to insure that valid selections are 
made in a number of list box controls. 
* Makes adjustments to the sizers in a number of the 
larger dialogs and the wizard to better fit on the 
smaller 800 x 600 pixel screens being used on the new 
generation of mini notebook computers. 
* Updates the documentation for version 4. 
* Makes a few changes to the localization files. This is 
the first version advertised to the user community.

New WX Version 4.0.0 initial release 16Oct2008:

Adapt It WX is an entirely new version of Adapt It based 
on the wxWidgets Cross-Platform GUI Library. This new 
version of Adapt It is no longer dependent on Microsoft's 
MFC programming framework, nor does it utilize the .NET 
Framework, but is now independent of Microsoft's 
proprietary technologies in order to become a truly 
cross-platform application. See the "Known Issues and 
Limitations.txt" file for information on how this 
cross-platform version differs from previous legacy 
versions.

(See the legacy version 3.6.4 for changes prior to this 
new release of Adapt It WX)
