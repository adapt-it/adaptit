----------------------------------------------
Version 6.0.0 update working on release late 2010 or early 2011
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 6.0.0
----------------------------------------------
New Features in 6.0.0:
* Additional "white space" characters are supported in the Unicode
build, which means that when parsing in source text the presence of 
any of these characters will result in a word break:
	U+200B ZWSP (Zero Width SPace) 
	U+2009 THSP (THin SPace)
	U+200A HSP (Hair SPace - thinner than THSP)
	U+200D ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner)
* Words and phrases in the target text which differ from the source 
 text immediately above them are given a different colour. The 
 colour used is setable from the Preferences / Fonts page.
* Source text exported from a document can now be edited outside
 of Adapt It, and then imported back into the same document using
 a new command "Import Edited Source Text..." on the Export-Import
 menu. Material that is unchanged retains all the adaptation information,
 but material that is new or altered appears as unadapted "holes" ready
 for adapting. The document may then be saved manually if the result 
 is satisfactory.
* User Profiles support for an administrator to customize access to 
 certain functionalities. Default user workflow profiles are provided 
 for Novice, Experienced, Skilled, and Custom users. Each of these 
 default user profiles can be further customized by the administrator 
 to hide or make accessible over 60 of Adapt It's interface elements 
 including many of its menu bar items, mode bar items, tool bar items, 
 Preference tab pages, etc. We believe this new feature can be utilized 
 by an administrator to reduce complexity and/or confusion for new users, 
 and offer an effective means of introducing features as they are needed
by team members.
* OXES version 1 export support. [development is in progress]
* Standard format exports now export the Adapt It custom markers
\free, \free*, \note, \note* and \bt in a form which Paratext is happy
to ignore: \zfree, \zfree*, \znote, \znote* and \zbt. Also, source text
data with either forms of these markers will be parsed in correctly for 
document creation within Adapt It.
* The order of fields in standard format exports, particularly a 
target text or source text export, has been altered. The information 
is export in the following order (not all these types may be present 
at any one location of course): 1. filtered information 2. a collected 
back translation 3. a note, 4. a free translation, 5 the adaptation 
(or source) text itself. The old order was 2,4,3,1, which did not 
conform well to USFM expected ordering. Creating an adaptation document 
from one of these exports gives the same result as before - nothing 
is different.
* On the languages page of the Start Working... wizard, the checkbox
"Recognise standard format markers only following newlines" has been 
removed, because the code for this feature has been broken now for 
several years, and appears to be no longer needed.
* The order of fields in standard format exports, particularly a target 
text or source text export, has been altered. The information is export 
in the following order (not all these types may be present at any one 
location of course): 1. filtered information 2. a collected back 
translation 3. a note, 4. a free translation, 5 the adaptation (or 
source) text itself. The old order was 2,4,3,1, which did not conform 
well to USFM expected ordering. Creating an adaptation document from 
one of these exports gives the same result as before - nothing is 
different.
* The knowledge base has been upgraded to version 2. It now stores
the datetime for creation of an entry, modification of an entry, and
deletion of an entry; also, a field for who created the entry. 
"Deletion" of an entry now does not physically delete it, rather 
the entry is marked as deleted and is hidden, but remains in the 
knowledge base. If the user later creates the same adaptation, the 
KB will silently "undelete" the deleted entry.
Note: The XML format that will be used for knowledge bases in version 
6.0.0 (kbVersion 2) is not compatible with the XML format used by the 
knowledge bases prior to version 6.0.0 (kbVersion 1). The kbVersion 1 
format applies to all versions from 1.0.0 up to and including 5.2.3; 
The kbVersion 2 format applies from version 6.0.0 and onwards. Using 
6.0.0 or later versions will automatically transform a kbVersion 1 
knowledge base to kbVersion 2 format. It is important to realize 
that once that is done, earlier versions of Adapt It will not read 
a kbVersion 2 knowledge base, assume it is corrupted and empty the 
knowledge base file - so be warned. Before upgrading to Adapt It 
version 6.0.0, you should make a backup of your KB files by Using 
the Export Knowledge Base command on the Export-Import menu. The KB 
backup should be either in LIFT format, or in \lx and \ge format -- 
the latter is best because such a file preserves all the datetime 
and other kbVersion 2 information, whereas LIFT format doesn't; and 
all versions of Adapt It, from 1.0.0 to 6.0.0 and beyond can 
successfully read a KB stored as \lx & \ge records, even when such 
a file was produced by 6.0.0 or later versions.
* The Export-Import menu now supports exporting the knowledge base 
in LIFT format, and importing data to the knowledge base from a 
LIFT format file. KB export as LIFT xml is now the default, the 
older KB export in the form of \lx & \ge fields is still supported, 
but to get it the user must drop down the combobox for the export 
type and select this option. Exporting the KB in LIFT format only 
exports source text and adaptation (or gloss, if exporting when in 
glossing mode), and all datetime and other information in the KB 
is lost.
* KB export and import in the form of records using \lx and \ge 
fields has been extended to support the extra information in 
kbVersion 2; and <Not In KB> entries are included in the export 
(whereas for kbVersion 1 exports of this type they were excluded); 
also, each time the user asks for an SFM export of the KB, a 
message box pops up to ask how deleted KB entries (which remain 
in the KB, but are hidden from the user) should be handled in 
the export - whether or not to include them in the export. (This 
option is present because to include them in the export, if the 
exported data is to be imported to the KB of a legacy version of 
Adapt It, would effectively make them become undeleted in the 
legacy version's KB - which is unlikely to be helpful to the user. 
But if the exported KB data is just a KB backup, then the deleted 
entries should be included in the export.)
There are additional custom SF markers for the extra kbVersion 2
information, as follows:
   \del for storing the deleted flag (1 if deleted, 0 if not deleted)
   \cdt  for the creation date and time
   \mdt for the modification date and time
   \ddt for the deletion date and time
   \wc for the "who created" string, of form: username:machinename
(or, when web use is supported, probably an ip address)
Note: if you want to safeguard the KB contents by storing it in a 
file somewhere, this is the export type which you should do. It retains 
ALL the information in kbVersion 2. Not only that, legacy Adapt It 
versions (1.0.0 to 5.2.3) can still read this kind of exported KB 
data successfully, because they will just ignore the extra 
information in the above custom fields.
* The internal format of Adapt It adaptation documents has been 
upgraded to a new XML document format (docVersion 5). The previous 
XML document format, docVersion 4, has been in operation for about 
4 years. Users using version 6.0.0 or onwards on legacy documents, 
will find that their legacy documents are silently upgraded to 
docVersion 5 and saved in that (somewhat different) xml format - and 
most or all parsing glitches embedded in the older documents (such 
as 'orphaned' punctuation and bad parsing of !$ fixed space marker) 
will be automatically corrected at the same time.
NOTE: parsing of words conjoined by !$ (USFM fixed space marker)
will not parse correctly if the word before or after the !$ marker has
internal punctuation. Punctuation at the ends of either word is 
acceptable and will parse correctly, but a word such as ba:te will 
not. (Unicode has non-punctuation characters with glyphs which look
like punctuation marks - if your data uses those as word building
characters, there will be no problems with Adapt It's parsing. This 
restriction about 'no internal punctuation in words' applies only to
words conjoined with !$ fixed space marker; other words will parse
correctly even if they have internal punctuation symbols.)
* Legacy versions of Adapt It (prior to and including 5.2.3) will 
not be able to read docVersion 5 xml documents. Only the legacy
version 5.2.4 is capable of reading the new xml format. Upgrading 
the internal document model to version 5 was necessitated by certain
complex USFM markup scenarios that the legacy document model could
not handle adequately.
Note: to give limited support to people in teams where some may 
be working with a legacy Adapt It version (5.2.3 or earlier), and 
others in the team with 6.0.0 or later, we have included an option 
for saving the current document in docVersion 4, doing so from 
within version 6.0.0 or later. This option is available from the 
File / Save As... command. (Send the document file saved as 
docVersion 4 to whoever needs it before you do any more work in 
it with Adapt It version 6.0.0 or later, because when you next 
work on it using 6.0.0, it will automatically revert back to 
being in docVersion 5 format.)
* On the File menu there is now a Save As... command. It can 
be used to save a document with a new name (that is, the 
document is renamed, and no longer will be on disk with its 
earlier name). It can also be used to have the document saved 
in legacy docVersion 4 format. (However, when next opened in 
the same version of Adapt It, the document will automatically 
be restored to docVersion 5.) The Save As... command will not 
let you change the folder in which the document is to be saved.
* Although unseen to the user, Adapt It version 6.0.0 and later 
versions have undergone extensive internal changes. These changes 
will make it easier for the developers to maintain, and to provide 
versions of the application for a number of new platforms, 
collaborative contexts, and work environments.
* The "Transform Adaptations To Glosses..." functionality has 
been improved. It no longer removes placeholders and retranslations 
from the transformed project, but just transforms their adaptations 
to glosses as expected. Also the transformation of adaptation to 
glosses now also takes place on any hidden original data storage 
elements stored on a merger - so that if the user later unmerges 
any of these, he'll see glosses as expected rather than 
untransformed adaptations.
* The "Transform Adaptations Into Glosses..." feature has been 
improved. Formerly it erased the target project's adaptations and 
glossing KBs, then transformed the "other project's" adaptations 
KB into the target project's glossing KB, and then converted 
adaptions to glosses for the "other project's" documents. This 
behaviour made it difficult to use the command more than once, 
because it would destroy any adapting work done in the target 
project, and lose the target project's KB data. The new behaviour 
preserves the adapting and glossing KB data in the target project 
while adding to it from the transformation process; and any "other 
project" document file which has the same name as a document file 
already in the target project, is skipped (even if chosen by the 
user for being transformed) - thereby protecting any adaptating 
work done in the target project since the last transformation
process. These changes make it safe to do use the Transform 
Adaptations To Glosses command as many times as desired, as 
completed "Other project" adaptation documents become completed 
and therefore available for transformation. In addition, because 
the process no longer loses KB data, the warning message about 
what used to get lost now no longer needs to be shown. Also the 
transformation of adaptation to glosses now also takes place on 
any hidden original data storage elements stored on a merger - 
so that if the user later unmerges any of these, he'll see 
glosses as expected rather than untransformed adaptations.
* If the user cancelled from the Which Files? dialog when doing 
a restore of the knowledge base, the knowledge base was left 
emptied. Now the application will make a temporary copy of the  
current knowledge base before attempting the restore, and if the  
user cancels, then the knowledge base is restored automatically  
without any changes to it having taken place.
* The Which Files? dialog has two additional buttons: 
"Move All Right >>" and "<< Move All Left" which move all the 
filenames with a single click.
* We no longer export filtered information in the glosses export,
nor the free translation export. (Doing so was ridiculous - the
filtered information was neither glossed nor free translated,  
and could not ever be so while filtered, so there was no point
in exporting it.)
* The Help menu no longer has the Adapt It Forum menu item, but 
now has two more helpful menu items: (1) Report a problem... menu 
item which provides a dialog containing a partially filled in 
report form which can be edited to provide developers with details 
and/or how to duplicate the problem, as well as ability to send the 
report via email with the click of a button, and (2) Give feedback... 
menu item which provides a dialog containing a partially filled in 
report form which can be edited to provide the developers with 
information on how Adapt It is being used - including successes 
and/or failures; features of Adapt It that are helpful/not helpful; 
what features could be improved or added to make Adapt It a better 
software tool.
* The Preferences dialog which is accessed from the Edit Menu 
(and/or the Adapt It application menu on a Mac) is now accessible 
when a project is open but no document in that project is open. 
Previously the user had to open a document to access the 
Preferences dialog.
* The USFM tab and Filtering tab in the Preferences dialog has
been combined into a single tab.
* Prior to version 6.0.0 a few user settings (the File menu's file 
history and interface language choice) were stored in the Windows 
registry. Now these settings are stored in an external file called 
Adapt_IT_WX.ini on Windows systems.
* Adapt It now provides a Guesser function which attempts to guess 
the adaptation for source words or phrases which currently have no 
translations stored in its knowledge base. The Guesser is 
statistical so it suggests guesses only after a knowledge base has 
sufficient data in it to make relatively accurate guesses. The 
Guesser is ON by default but can be turned off or its settings 
adjusted easily by clicking on the new toolbar icon to the right 
of the Print toolbar icon. When a guess has been placed in the 
phrase box the background color of the phrase box turns to an 
orange color (the color can be changed in the Guesser Settings
dialog).
* Adapt It now uses a new logo and set of icons for a more 
contemporary look on all platforms.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 6.0.0
----------------------------------------------
* Cancelling the Choose Translation dialog it would reopen and require
a second press of the Cancel button to succeed in closing by cancelling.
* In some circumstances a duplicate adaptation, or gloss, entry would be 
added to the set of previously seen adaptations, or glosses, for a given
source text word or phrase. As well as fixing this, some other less than
optimal KB entry management behaviours were improved as well.
* For several years, a user or two has reported an overlap problem of the 
phrase box with the text either before it, or after it. Noone, including the 
developers, could reproduce this error at will. We have put in some extra 
checks and associated 'fix it' code which should make this problem never 
happen again.
* Removing a lot of source text near the end of the document and 
there were several notes in the removed section, the app would crash.
* Certain standard format markers in the USFM standard were included
in a free translation export. These were markers for things like bold,
italic, glossary word, and so forth. If a merger was done to form a
phrase resulting in one of these becoming a 'medial marker' to the 
phrase, then an RTF export of the free translation would terminate at
the unmatched end-marker which was not in the merger. These kinds of
markers are now automatically removed, making the RTF export well-behaved.
* The search function in the KB Editor dialog would fail to match 
stored adaptations (or glosses) other than the first for source text
keys which have multiple adaptations (or multiple glosses).
* When launching and the phrase box is at a "hole" where the source
text has two or more possible adaptations, the Choose Translation
opened (which was corrrect) but then when dismissed it re-opened.
* Repeated Move Up or Move Down button presses in the Choose 
Translation dialog would get the reference counts messed up.
* If the user had an adaptation in the phrase box, then unticked the
checkbox "Save to knowledge base" and immediately saved the document
and knowledge base, and then inspected the KB, the "<Not In KB>" entry
would display along with the phrase box's contents as a visible
alternative. This is now corrected, and only <Not In KB> will appear.
* In rare circumstances, a single-word lookup of the KB at a location
designated as "<Not In KB>" in the KB entry, the <Not In KB> string
would appear in the phrase box. Now, it just show puts an empty string
in the phrase box.
* If the user cancelled for the attempt to create a new document, 
subsequent attempts to create a new document, or to open an existing
document, did not work correctly.
* Choosing the command to collect back translation, or the command to
remove collected back translations, did not update the main window 
after the command completed.
* If a Save was requested while the phrase box was not in existence
because the end of the document had been reached, the application
crashed.
* Editing the source text crashed the application if the edit was 
done on the text stored at a single pile of the display.
* If a placeholder was within a selection intended for a retranslation
operation, the placeholder was supposed to be silently removed after
the data it contained was mined - but instead the application would
crash. It now works as it was designed to.
* Any SFM export would have a bogus space put preceding an endmarker. 
This no longer happens.
* Parsing input text with punctuation following an endmarker would
result in the punctuation being placed on an extra storage element with
no source text. This, and a number of non-compliance issues with 
complex USFM markup are now fixed.
* The Delete All Notes button, in some recent versions, failed to  
work (an introduced error), it's now fixed.
* The application would crash if trying to export a free translation
from a document containing an unknown SFM marker (e.g. \y )
* Free translating within a footnote, cross reference or endnote, the
automatically generated end of the section stopped one word short of 
the actual end of the footnote, cross reference or endnote contents.
* In free translation mode, clicking on a different section, the phrase 
box would show the source text word rather than the adaptation word
(or phrase) at the clicked section's anchor location.
* It was possible, when a free translation applied to a certain span of
text, for a click at the start of the source text for a word within that
span to wrongly open the View Filtered Information dialog, even though
there was no wedge icon present at that location.
* If the document was scrolled away from the top, and the user clicked
the command on the Layout direction which changes the layout direction,
the window's display was garbled until the next window update.
* Support for opening Adapt It with command line switches such as 
-frm (force review mode) has been broken from version 5.2.1 and 
onwards; it's fixed again now.
* Doing an SFM export of, say, the source text, and specifying that a
marker be filtered, resulted in the words before and after the filtered 
marker and its content and endmarker being wrongly joined as a bogus
composite word due to loss of the intervening space between them.

----------------------------------------------
Version 5.2.4 update 31January2011:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.2.4
----------------------------------------------
* Attempting to open free translation mode when the document was
only a line or two in length, crashed the application.


----------------------------------------------
Version 5.2.3 update 29September2010:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.2.3
----------------------------------------------
* Attempting to run the application on some localized versions 
of Windows Vista would, on some computers, cause a crash. (The 
problem was caused by a wrong value being supplied to Adapt It 
for the Adapt It built-in interface localization functionality. 
Code to protect against this has been added.)
* Creating a CC table using the Unicode application, the 
application crashed after the user created a filename for the 
CC table.
* The placeholder insertion mechanism had become partly broken, 
in particular, inserting a placeholder after a word which ended 
with punctuation, and telling Adapt It to associate the 
placeholder leftwards, the left association did not happen and 
the punctuation did not get transferred to the end of the 
placeholder. Similar problems with right association happened 
too.
* The following sequence of actions caused a crash. Select some
source text words, do File / Close, then do some command which 
tried to remove the left-over selection parameters before the 
layout was re-created & updated, such as a document Open attempt.

Version 5.2.2 update 17April2010:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.2.2
----------------------------------------------
* Users of Adapt It on Windows 98 systems found that the Regular
version of Adapt It (versions 5.2.0 and 5.2.1) would not start on 
their Windows 98 systems. Instead they would get an error message 
saying the "the [path]\Adapt_It.exe file expects a newer version 
of Windows. Upgrade your Windows version." This has now been
corrected and Adapt It Regular version 5.2.2 will now run on 
Windows 98 systems.
* Adapt It WX Regular version also no longer gives a warning 
message at startup about not being able to locate ECDriver.dll.

Version 5.2.1 update 29March2010:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 5.2.1
----------------------------------------------
* Up until 5.2.1, 3-letter book codes needed to be in all upper case. 
For example, HAG for  the book of Haggai, and it would not recognise 
hag or Hag as a 3-letter book code; similarly for other 3-letter codes 
in lower or mixed case. From now on, however, upper, lower or mixed 
case 3-letter book codes are all recognised correctly.
* After using the KB Editor Search feature, the message suggesting
that a consistency check be done does not come up now unless the
user actually changed at least one adaptation (or, if in glossing 
mode, at least one gloss).
* Adapt It now shows its internal version number in Windows Explorer
and other file browsers when displaying its file properites.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.2.1
----------------------------------------------
* Having source text selected when invoking any of the Split Document 
or Join Document commands resulted in a crash when the application
tried to remove the selection at the end of the operation.
* Reatranslating a footnote at the end of the document with a longer 
footnote caused a crash.
* Doing Restore Knowledge Base when in book folder mode, when the
restore starts working through the book folders it fell into an 
infinite loop.

Version 5.2.0 update 15March2010:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 5.2.0
----------------------------------------------
* Added a hidden password protected Administrator menu. The menu can 
be made visible by Edit / Preferences / View tab, and click the 
checkbox labelled "Show Administrator Menu (Password protected)". 
The Administrator menu now supports extra capabilities of interest 
to the administrator of a number of machines running Adapt It on a 
LAN, such as setting up a work folder in a custom location, moving 
data to or from the accessed custom work folders (e.g. for archiving 
in a version control repository, etc.). We plan to add more features 
to the Administrator menu in the future, including the ability to 
customize the Adapt It interface and hide or disable certain Adapt It 
menus and features. Our priority for this release has been to implement 
the following features which now work on the Administrator menu: 
(1) Custom Work Folder Location, (2) Lock Custom Location, (3) Unlock 
Custom Location, (4) Restore Default Work Folder Location, (5) Set 
Password, and (6) Move Or Copy Folders Or Files. 
* Added a Custom Work Folder Location command to the Administrator 
menu. This permits the administrator to set either (1) a temporary 
custom work folder location on the local machine, a peripheral device, 
or a remote machine - including a remote machine running a different 
operating system; the setting lasts until the end of the session, or 
(2) A permanent custom work folder location on the local machine or on 
a peripheral device attached to the local machine. With this added
feature, it is quite possible that more than one instance of Adapt It 
may attempt to access the same project at the same time on a given
computer. In such cases Adapt It now has a read-only projection
mechanism in place (see next feature below).
* Added a Lock Custom Location command to the Administrator menu. This 
menu item is enabled provided the path to the custom folder is not a 
path accessible as a network share. When activated the work folder at 
the custom location becomes permanent, until explicitly changed at 
some future time (see Unlock Custom Location feature below).
* Added an Unlock Custom Location command to the Administrator menu.
This item is enabled provided the path to the custom folder is not a 
path accessible as a network share, so that the persistent work folder 
custom location becomes temporary - i.e. the path will be forgotten 
when the current session ends.
* Added a Restore Default Work Folder Location command which restores
the default work folder location (including returning to the use of a
work folder location set up earlier by the -wf command line switch).
If this command is used when a custom work folder location has
previously been made persistent, then Adapt It does an implicit
call of the Unlock Custom Location as part of the process of returning
to the use of the default work folder at the default location. (Note:
there may not be any projects at the default location, so returning
there may also require moving project folders back there from the
former custom work folder; that task can be done by Administrator
menu commands, or with a file browser application outside of
Adapt It.)
* Added a Set Password command to the Administrator menu. The 
failsafe password admin will always work. You can set some other 
password. Your password is stored in the basic configuration file. 
* Added a Move Or Copy Folders Or Files command to the Administrator 
menu. This command brings up a dialog in which an administrator can 
move, copy, rename and/or delete folders and files providing a
flexible file and folder managing capability within Adapt It.
* Added automatic read-only protection functionality, so that if the 
local user navigates, using the Custom Work Folder Location command,
to a remote machine's Adapt It project folder which is currently
in use by the remote user, any kb or document saving attempts
by the local user will not do anything; the local user will only obtain
read-only access. Whichever of the two users who first accesses a given
project will get ownership write privileges within the project folder,
the user who arrives at the project folder second, will only get
read-only access (actually, he will be able to do things normally on
the local copy in memory from the remote machine's drive, but any
attempt to save work to the remote machine will only simulate 
a successful save, in actual fact, no save is done). This protects the
remote user from unknowingly losing work because of actions done
by a snooping administrator from a different machine somewhere on
the local network. Whoever gets ownership of the project folder
for writing, Adapt It will save a "lock" file with name
"~AIROP-machinename-username-processID-SYS.lock" in that folder, and 
open it for writing. Adapt It will fill in machinename, username,
processID and SYS with the appropriate names automatically retreived 
from the machine which is running the Adapt It instance that succeeded 
in obtaining ownership for writing. When no such file is present in 
a folder, the next person entering that folder will get ownership of 
it. The management of this functionality is totally automatic, no 
user or administrator need do anything in normal operation. Ownerhip 
is lost when you leave the project folder. It is gained when entering
the project folder, provided noone else alrealdy has ownership.
Whenever you open a new document in the project, an attempt is made 
to give you ownership rights - but you won't get them unless the 
previous owner has relinquished the project folder. This protection 
functionality is "always turned on". It can't be turned off. It works 
whether or not you are trying to access a folder on a remote machine, 
or just doing your normal work on your own machine. If you run two
instances of Adapt It on the same computer, and both attempt to gain
access to the same project, the first to gain access will have write
access, the other will have read-only access. A special case ensues 
if the administrator gains full access to a project on a remote 
machine, and a user on the remote machine then tries to open that 
project which exists on his own local machine. He will be allowed 
to have either read-only access (the usual case), or if his computer 
has a Linux or Mac operating system, he can gain full write access. 
If he opts for full write access the administrator's access will 
immediately switch to read-only access in order to protect data 
integrity. When a user has read-only access (whether local user or 
administrator a project remotely), he will not be able to write KB or 
documents to disk until the other user having write access has 
relinquished ownership of the project. Gaining write access after 
having read-only access (and after the other user relinquishes 
ownership of the project) requires that the current user close the 
document or project first, then reenter the project. That is, whoever 
opens the project first, gets ownership; whoever arrives second, only 
gets read-only access and must close and reenter to gain write access 
once the first user has left the project. This protocol prevents 
inadvertent loss of data.
* If a user accesses an Adapt It project located on a different
computer over a network, Adapt It tries to substitute a suitable
font to match what was used on the other computer. If no font with 
the same face name exists on the user's own computer, Adapt It will
attempt to find a font with a similar encoding. If that fails, the 
user will be notified which fonts could not be found, and a system 
font will be used instead. If the system font does not render the text 
correctly, it may be necessary for the user to select a suitable font 
from his own Preferences (on the Edit menu), or if no compatible font 
is available on his computer, he may need to first install a font which 
is compatible with the fonts used on the other machine on the network. 
This may happen especially if the other machine being accessed uses a 
different operating system - such as when a Windows computer accesses 
an Adapt It project on a Linux or a Mac computer, or a Linux or Mac 
user accesses an Adapt It project on a Windows computer, etc.
* Added support for knowledge base searches. To do this, the dialog 
for the Edit Knowledge Base command has some extra controls at the 
bottom -
   (a) a multiline text box where target text search strings can be 
typed
   (b) a Go button which initiates the search
   (c) an Erase All Lines button which clears out the multiline text
box's strings if the user does not want what he has typed and wants
to start over by typing different strings
   (d) a Combobox control which lists all older search strings that the
user typed while within the current project during the current
session - this control is cleared automatically when the user leaves
the project.
Note: the KB search is "smart". In the multiline text box where target
text search strings are typed, one or more words or parts of words, 
each separated by a space, can be typed. All the words in a "line" 
must match, in the order in which they were typed, for a KB adaptation
(or gloss, if glossing mode is currently on) to be accepted as a
successful match. The search text "line" can be longer than the width
of the multiline text control - and although a long typed string may
wrap over more than one physical line, it is still a single search 
string. The user must end the line by explicitly pressing the Enter 
key. Searching supports discontinuous matches. If the user wanted to
match all KB entries in which there is somewhere the string "ing" 
followed somewhere, even if many words away, by the string "ed",
then in the multiline text box he would type (without the doubequotes)
"ing ed"  (note, there must be at least one space between each part
which is to be separately matched).
Once the Go button has been pressed, the whole KB is searched for
matches to whatever occurs on any one "line" in the search box. As
many search string "lines" can be typed for a single search operation
as desired - the only thing to bear in mind is that if there are many
search string lines, the searching will take longer. 
After the matches have been collected internally, a dialog opens to 
display the matched KB entries in a list. The user may either use the
horizontal scroll bar, or drag the dialog's boundary to widen it 
sufficiently to see all of the contents of a long entry.
The "Respell or Inspect Matched Knowledge Base Items" dialog provides 
the following features:
   (a) click on a matched entry, it then appears in an Edit box where
it can be respelled if the user wishes.
   (b) click on an Update button to cause a respelled adaptation (or
gloss, if in glossing mode) to be added to an Updated Spellings list
which is to the left of the list of matched KB entries.
   (c) the items in the two lists are linked, so clicking on an item 
in either causes the other list's corresponding item to be selected, 
and the Edit box to have the appropriate string placed in it.
   (d) a Remove Update button allows the user to reject a respelled 
item and it is removed from the Updated Spellings list and the 
formerly updated spelling is still shown in the Edit box, but the 
original spelling remains in the Matched list.
   (e) a Restore Original Spelling button does the same as the Remove
Update button, except the Edit box shows the original spelling.
   (f) because the Matched list may have many items in it, a text box 
is provided for a search string to be typed, and a Find Next button
initiates the search, and if a matching item is found, it is scrolled 
into view. (This search is not smart, it tries to match the whole 
string as typed, including any spaces within it.)
   (g) when the OK button is clicked, Adapt It looks at the contents 
of the Updated Spellings list, and updates the KB entries to which 
they belong.
   (h) the Cancel button rejects the whole of the current search - no 
KB entries are updated, the search string lines which the user had 
typed are thrown away, any new spellings in the Updated Spellings list 
are ignored.
   (i) on return to the parent dialog (and provided the Cancel button 
was not clicked), the set of typed search string "lines" are added to 
the contents of the combo box, so that at a later time it is easy to 
search for any of those "lines" again. Also, a message reminds the 
user that spellings were changed and that has made the knowledge base 
inconsistent with the adaptation documents. It suggests that a 
consistency check of the whole set of documents be done when the 
parent dialog closes, and if the Yes button is clicked, the user is 
shown the dialog for choosing to consistency check either the current 
document, or all documents.
* Added support for a "force reviewing mode" to be turned on at 
program launch. This can be activated by use of the -frm command line 
switch. Do not use this switch unless you know what you are doing. It
puts Adapt It into 'Reviewing mode' on launch, and hides both the
Drafting and Reviewing radio buttons, so that in that session the
user becomes locked in to reviewing mode. This is useful when a 
"dumb mode" for back translating is wanted. No lookup of the KB is 
done, the phrase box does not copy source text nor make an initial 
suggestion of any kind, and no auto insertions are done, but the KB 
still gets populated in the normal way as the user types back 
translations into the phrase box. This feature can be used with a 
shell script launch of Adapt It, to force this mode on, on a per-session
basis. That's one way this feature could be used. Another way is to 
setup a desktop shortcut and in the shortcut properties' Target box, 
add the -frm switch to the end of the path. Whatever you do, be sure 
that the normal way to launch Adapt It does not have the -frm switch 
used, otherwise you'll lock the user (or yourself) out of essential 
adaptation functionalities at every launch. You've been warned!
* Added support for an automated export (default options used) of the 
adaptation line's text, using the command line. The command line 
requires four parameters, and all must be present in the following 
order: export  projectfoldername  documentname  pathtooutputfolder. 
Put double quotes around any of these names or the path parameter, if 
there are spaces within. This feature is used by the SendIt utility 
which John Hatton has developed. SendIt allows the user to select a 
document from a list of documents currently in the project and it 
will then automatically generate the required export of the adaptation 
line's data to a file and attach the file to an email to be sent by 
HF radio using UUplus.
* Added extra information to the status bar display, so that the
user has feedback about which location the project is being accessed 
from. The information is displayed in [ ] brackets, and there are 
three possibilities:
   [Default Work Folder Location]
   [Temporary Work Folder Location]
   [Custom Work Folder Location]
The first of the above is for the legacy situation; the second is when
the Custom Work Folder Location command is used from the Administrator 
menu to point Adapt It at a work folder in a non-standard location 
(and the folder name could be anything). The third is like the second, 
but the use has also used the command Lock Custom Location to make the 
new work folder location be persistent across sessions. Also, the 
status message now also distinguishes "Adapting" versus "Reviewing" 
modes, in the first word of the message.
* Added a Swahili interface localization.
* The Spanish language interface localization is more complete than in 
previous releases, but the work of editing and correcting some text 
strings is still in progress. Fully updated localizations are planned 
for future updates, but we are dependent on help from others who can
translate computer interface elements. Let us know if you can devote
time to completing any of the existing language interface 
localizations or preparing new ones.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.2.0
----------------------------------------------
* The Edit menu commands, Move Note Forward, and Move Note Backward, 
did their job but the window was not updated to show the changed 
location of the note.
* Typing a '2' key into the phrase box, or the edit box used for free
translations, no 2 character appeared in the box. This is now fixed.
* Unmerging a merger which located at the end of the document caused 
a crash.
* In Review mode, the application crashed after the user entered
text into the phrase box at the end of the document.
* In Review mode, text entered in the phrase box at the document end 
was not retained.
* Pointing My Documents (in XP) or Documents (in Vista & above) at a 
partition such as D:\ caused a bad path to the basic configuration
file to be produced, leading to error messages, or worse.
* Free translating a large file become progressively more sluggish as 
free translations were entered. It's now speedy and responsive.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.1.4
----------------------------------------------
* Arabic text did not display certain punctuation characters in
correct RTL order, but instead located them at the wrong end 
of words as if they were LTR text.

Version 5.1.3 update 2September2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.1.3
----------------------------------------------
* During an export of the knowledge base, if an <Not In KB>
entry was found, it caused the export to get into an infinite
loop and produce an increasingly huge file on disk until eventually
a crash occurred.
* Fixed failure of change of highlight colour for auto insertions
to "stick" beyond closing the colour dialog.
* Export of glosses omitted exporting of a gloss phrase when 
the gloss phrase was added after the merger was done in
adaptation mode. It now doesn't omit such data, and if an
embedded marker is within the phrase, a "Place Phrase
Internal Marker" dialog shows for the user to place the
phrase-internal marker correctly, during the export. (This is
identical to how phrase internal markers are handled when 
exporting the target text.)
* When doing either a free translation or glosses text export, and the
button Export Filter/Options is clicked, the list does not show
\note, \free nor \bt (or derivatives) markers because these are 
obligatorily not included in such exports, so there is no point in
displaying them as a filterable choice.
* The checkbox for "no automatic document saves" was turned on
for the first session after just installing for the first time. This was 
dangerous because a power failure could then result in work loss if
the new user had not done any manal document saves. The checkbox
now defaults to being off, so that automatic saves are ON by default.
* When the user has adapted all the document and the phrase box
has become invisible, if he then used the Step Up button the application
crashed.
* Exporting the knowledge base, a bug was introduced recently and
first line entries had information doubled up, looking like:
\lx word\lx word
this is now fixed.
* The Auto-Saving page of the Preferences did not have the spin 
buttons hooked up to the text boxes which display their value. They
now work correctly.
* Includes an updated ECDriver.dll for use with the current version
of SIL Converters.

Version 5.1.0 update 15August2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 5.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* Moved all the export functionalities to a new menu: Export-Import; 
both for exporting from the document, and exporting/importing 
the knowledge base. (Gives a less cluttered File menu.)
* Added an Export Free Translation... functionality to the new
Export-Import top level menu. By default, the 
Export Free Translation... command exports all the SFMs except for 
Notes and Back Translations. If the inclusion of text associated with 
other SFMs clutters the output, the user can run the command again, 
and this time use the Export Filter/Options button and in the child 
dialog he can then tick the checkboxes for any markers which he 
wants to be filtered out of the exported data.
* Adapt It remembers the path of the last used export location for
Free Translations in its project configuration file.
* Added an Export Glosses As Text... functionality to the new
Export-Import top level menu. By default, the Export Glosses As Text...
command exports all the SFMs except for Free Translations, Notes, 
and Back Translations. If the inclusion of text associated with 
other SFMs clutters the output, the user can run the command again, 
and this time use the Export Filter/Options button and in the child 
dialog he can then tick the checkboxes for any markers which he 
wants to be filtered out of the exported data. 
* Adapt It remembers the path of the last used export location for
Glosses As Text in its project configuration file.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: Splitting a document with the option "at a chapter marker"
caused a crash.
* Bug fix: Splitting a document with the one-chapter-per-file option 
caused a crash.
* Both Split and Join failed to update the final open document's 
filename on the Title bar. This is now fixed.
* Fixed bug that made the middle edit box in the View Filtered Dialog
read only. It is now editable as it was in versions prior to 5.0.0.
* Fixes this bug: the basic configuration file is saved at exit of the
app with the value for the Hide Punctuation line set to 0. When 
this was the case, the next launch of the application correctly hid 
the punctuation, but the button for changing the setting would do 
nothing. Now this parameter is no longer stored in any 
configuration file, and the application always shows the text with 
punctuation when first a document is opened. Also, now if the 
application gets out of sync with the flag for controlling this 
feature, clicking the command bar button will rectify the situation, 
and then subsequent clicks of the button will toggle the setting's 
value as normal.

Version 5.0.1 update 3August2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes and new features in 5.0.1
----------------------------------------------
* Fixes a crash at the point that the progress dialog is displayed 
when changing the filtering settings within a document. 
* The filtering mechanism also now restores the phrase box 
contents at the active location properly. Unfiltering will do the
same except when the new active location is within unfiltered
material - in that circumstance the best it can do is to restore
the phrase box empty - because earlier filtering has thrown away
adaptation and gloss information which cannot therefore be 
recovered by unfiltering.
* Fixes the following bug: after working in a document and
closing it with File / Close, then doing File / New and creating a
new document, the project's knowledge base file had its contents
erased.
* Fixes the following bug: if the File / MRU list is used to select
a document created earlier in order to open it again, the 
application crashed.
* Fixes the following bug: opening a document from the MRU 
list, particularly if transferring from a Right To Left project to a
Left To Right project, resulted in wrong display characteristics
and other usage problems. Transfers now go smoothly and 
LTR versus RTL differences don't any more arise in the 
transition results.
* Fixes the following bug: Doing a Find operation where the 
matched text happens to lie within a retranslation resulted in the
phrase box wrongly being placed at the first pile of the
retranslation, and showing the wrong contents. This situation
should show the whole retranslation selected but the phrase
box disengaged from being "under" the selected source text. 
That is now what happens, the phrase box is immediately
before the retranslation and the source text above the phrase
box is not selected (because the following retranslation is
selected instead). This is the situation we want if the user
were to then Cancel from the Find Next, and decide to edit the
contents of the selected retranslation.

Version 5.0.0 update 21July2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 5.0.0
----------------------------------------------
* Adapt It's display and interface has eliminated the "bundle"
concept and now handles whole files as a unit.
* Scrolling can now be accomplished from beginning to the end
of a large document without the need to "Step Up" or "Step
 Down" through the document.
* Responsiveness while adapting long (book-length) documents 
has been improved, and is constant for all document lengths.
* The "Step Up" and "Step Down" toolbar buttons now act to
move through a document chapter-by-chapter.
* The phrase box is now positioned more intelligently on the
display and the display's automatic scrolling is more helpful
in keeping automatically inserted adaptations in view.
* Find and Replace functions have been revised and improved
and the display no longer displays separate pairs of source 
and target text lines (punctuated and non-punctuated) during 
Find and Replace operations.
* The Replace button no longer does the replacement and then
automatically advances to the next found text location that
matches. That behaviour prevented the user from seeing what 
the effect of the replacement was, and it took away the 
chance of doing further editing before doing the next Find. 
Now the Find Next button has to be pressed explicitly once 
the user is ready, each time after a replacement has been 
done. (Replace All works as it did earlier.)
* The toggle buttons for switching on/off two source text 
lines the display, and / or two target text lines, have been 
removed.
* Use of the command bar button "Ignore Boundaries" has been
extended. It can be used preceding any of the three 
selection methods (click & drag, shift+click extension, or 
ALT+arrow keys) to allow selecting across punctuation 
boundaries. It can also be used that way after you have 
commenced a selection, except for the drag-select method.
* Re-established the legacy behaviour where if you click to 
place the phrase box elsewhere, when the phrase box has only 
copied source text which is still selected, the box contents 
are abandoned and nothing is entered into the document or 
knowledge base from the location that the box leaves.
* When typing into the phrase box, or deleting, blinking has 
been eliminated except for when a necessary update of the 
display is required because the width of the phrase box has 
changed.
* When re-opening Free Translation Mode at a location where 
a free translation has already been put, the application 
will automatically try to make a "best possible guess" at 
what the former setting was for free translation section 
length, and then set the radio button to conform 
accordingly - either to the "Punctuation" setting, or to 
the "Verse" setting. This also happens if you earlier 
changed the settings and you reenter a section which had a 
different setting in operation - you will see the radio 
button change to conform to that earlier setting at that 
location.
* Adapt It now can process an -wf <path> command-line 
option, where <path> is the path to a folder to be used as 
Adapt It's work folder. When this command-line option is 
used the <path> will be used instead of Adapt It's default 
work folder which has traditionally been called "Adapt It 
(Unicode) Work". The <path> following the -wf option can 
be on a different drive/volume or even a network path. 
This option can be added to the command-line on most 
systems by right-clicking on a menu item, shortcut, or 
launcher icon that is normally used to start Adapt It, 
and choosing "Properties" from the popup menu. Find the 
Command or Target field that invokes Adapt It, and add a 
space followed by  -wf  followed by another space and the
desired path. For example, the Command/Target field might 
look like this (on a Windows Start Menu item for 
Adapt It WX):

"C:\Program Files\Adapt It WX\Adapt_It.exe" -wf "e:\My Data"

in which case the project file(s) created by Adapt It 
would be located in the "My Data" folder on the e: drive 
volume. Note: paths containing spaces must be enclosed in 
quote marks. If no -wf <path> command-line argument is 
supplied Adapt It reverts completely back to its classic 
behavior of creating an "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder 
in the user's "(My) Documents" folder (or whatever path 
and folder name the OS reports is currently being used 
for documents by the user), and using that folder as its 
work folder.

If an administrator sets Adapt It up to use a custom work 
folder (using -wf <path>) AFTER data is already created at 
the default "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder location, 
Adapt It currently simply doesn't find the previously 
existing classic work folder, and will instead create/use 
what is specified in the -wf <path> command-line option. An 
administrator who sets up the custom work folder can at the 
same time, copy or move all of the projects from a previously 
existing "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder to the new custom 
work folder and Adapt It will just "see" them there at the 
custom specified <path> and all other previous program 
behaviors do not change.
* Adapt It now detects if a user of the Regular (non-Unicode)
version tries to input a new text for adaptation which is a 
Unicode encoded file, and aborts the input and informs the
user that the Unicode version of Adapt It must be used to
input and process Unicode files.
* Significant work has been done on the internal 
representation code for the view of the document in the 
main window. Due to these changes there are some unavoidable 
performance degradations for some actions. Changing anything 
(such as fonts, or font sizes) that affects the width of the 
text in each pile in the display is now "costly" - but only 
for large documents - because the internal representation 
of the view has to be totally rebuilt when such things 
happen. Therefore, when you change some settings in the 
Preferencess, you may have to wait several seconds for the 
document to update. Once such document rebuilding is done, 
however, performance will return to being speedy for all 
normal adapting, glossing, or free translating work.
* While we expect this version to be robust, please bear 
in mind that literally thousands of changes have been made
internally. We've tested it a lot, but if you do something 
and you get an unexpected behaviour, please let one of the 
developers know as soon as possible. The "About Adapt It"
menu item in the Help menu has email addresses for 
contacting us. We try to fix bugs within 24 hours.

----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 5.0.0
----------------------------------------------
* Editing source text, particularly if deleting source text, 
at the very end of the document would crash the application. 
This has been fixed.
* When a merge had been done across punctuation, a placement 
dialog came up which enabled you to specify where the 
punctuation should be placed within the target text. Formerly,
this dialog came up twice at a single location. This has been
fixed, it now comes up only once.
* Fixed the File > Print to correctly format printed pages
longer than two pages (previously pages 3ff would not format
correctly), and significantly reduced the wait time for the 
Print Preview and Print Options dialog to appear.
* Fixed the File > Print and File > Print Preview to 
correctly format Right to Left text projects.
* Fixed a memory leak that would happen if the user canceled
at the Print Options dialog.
* Fixed a number of bugs affecting Free Translation mode.
* Fixed a bug that might prevent a font color change from
being registered correctly.
* Fixed a bug that prevented a selection in the Auto-Saving 
tab of Preferences, from being remembered between sessions.
This involved the check box that gives the option to:
"Turn OFF periodic automatic saving of the document and 
knowledge base". Now the application will remember the 
check box selection.
* The Unicode version now detects when the user attempts
to input a non-Unicode text as a new source text. Adapt It
attempts to determine its encoding and convert the input
file to Unicode. As in the legacy version of Adapt It, the
conversion may not work completely if the text contains 
glyphs from a hacked 8-bit font that utilize point values 
above 127. 
* Fixed the ALT+RightArrow hot key when in the Choose
Translation dialog so that it now executes a "Cancel and
Select" operation in which the dialog closes and Adapt It
extends the selection one pile to the right.
* Fixed the operation of the radio buttons and edit box
next to the middle radio button in the Consistency Check
Dialog. Clicking in the edit box now automatically 
selects the associated radio button. Also, if the user
clicks in the edit box and starts typing the associated
radio button gets automatically selected if it wasn't
selected already.

Version 4.1.5 update 31May2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.5
----------------------------------------------
* A user can now edit the source text word/phrase at the
current location of the phrasebox without having to select
the source text word/phrase at that location. This
provides a more convenient way to change the spelling of
a source text word/phrase when the phrasebox is at that
location. Editing the source text in this manner can be
initiated via the Ctrl+Q hot key (Command-Shift-E on the 
Mac), or via the Edit Source Text... selection on the Edit
menu.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.5
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed the behavior of the View Filtered Material dialog 
so that it now allows editing of the text associated with
the marker that is selected. The dialog also closes when 
the user presses the Enter key, effectively pressing the
"Save Changes" button.
* Fixed the behavior of the Edit Source Text dialog so that
it now closes when the user presses the Enter key instead of
entering a newline in the dialog's edit box.
* Fixed some memory leaks in the Edit Source Text routines.
* Fixed a bug that was causing the application to think that 
punctuation had changed whenever the user clicked on the OK 
button of the Preferences dialog. The unnecessary processing 
of the document for punctuation changes could cause a 
noticeable delay after clicking OK in the Preferences dialog
in long documents.
* The automatic scrolling that Adapt It does during 
adaptation work should now do a better job of keeping the 
phrasebox within view.
* Using ALT+TAB on Windows to change between running 
applications should now display the Adapt It icon in the list 
of icon choices.

Version 4.1.4 update 29Apr2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.4
----------------------------------------------
* Adapt It now can process an -xo command-line option. The -xo 
command-line option was specifically designed to make Adapt It's 
interface work better on an OLPC XO machine running the BALSA 
distribution of Ubuntu Linux (Intrepid). The -xo option causes 
Adapt It to use a toolbar with larger (but fewer) buttons; a mode 
bar that spans two lines instead of a single line under the 
toolbar; and a few dialogs adjusted for better layout. The -xo 
option is not restricted to use on the OLPC XO; it can be added 
to the command-line on most systems by right-clicking on a menu 
item, shortcut, or launcher icon that is normally used to start 
Adapt It, and choosing "Properties" from the popup menu. Find 
the Command or Target field that invokes Adapt It, and add a 
space followed by the -xo option to the launching command.
* Updates the AI_USFM.xml USFM/style control file to coordinate 
with UBS USFM 2.208.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.4
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug that was displaying the wrong target phrase 
(usually a previous one) when the "Place medial punctuation" 
dialog appears during adaptation.
* Fixed a bug that was allowing final punctuation to enter the 
Knowledgebase and be stored in adapted documents. If a user's 
current knowledge base has wrongly admitted items with 
punctuation into fields that should not contain punctuation, 
the user can fix the problem by doing the following: 
   (1) run Adapt It, 
   (2) Choose the project but cancel out at the Document page 
       of the wizard so that no document is opened (or select 
       File > Close if a document was opened), and 
   (3) run the File > Restore Knowledgebase... command, 
       selecting all documents that should be used for 
       rebuilding the KB.
   (4) If Restore Knowledgebase... command discovered any 
       wrongly stored punctuation in the KB and adaptation 
       documents, the user is notified and an error log called 
       KBRestoreErrorLog.txt is saved in the project folder.
The rebuilt KB will no longer contain any final punctuation. 
If any of the documents used to restore the KB contained 
incorrectly stored punctuation, that punctuation is removed 
from the appropriate fields of those documents and the 
documents are re-saved. 
* Adapt It's position and size on the desktop is now 
preserved more consistently, between sessions. Also, if 
Adapt It's frame was maximized on last use, it starts the new 
session maximized, even when last used on a desktop spread 
across a second monitor with Adapt It on either monitor.
* Changed the Adapt It Help Topics to display the 
"Using Adapt It" HTML page as its starting page instead of 
the Glossary page. Also fixed a number of reported dead links 
in the HTML Help files.

Mac version:
* Fixed a number of issues in the new Mac version. Note: 
Although the Mac version is newly released, its version 
numbers are assigned to be concurrent with the version 
numbers for Windows and Linux versions.

Linux version:
* Adapt It can now be configured for a better layout of its 
interface when running on a computer with high dpi 
resolution screen (like the OLPC XO). When Adapt It is 
invoked with the -xo command-line option, Adapt It 
substitutes a toolbar with double sized buttons/images, and 
spreads the check box and other items in the mode bar over 
two rows of controls so they won't disappear off the right 
end of the main window. Some other dialogs have also been 
adjusted to layout better on these high dpi resolution 
screens.

Version 4.1.2 update 24Mar2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.2
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a crash in the Linux version that could happen 
when a text was adapted fully to the end of the document. 
The message "The End. Providing..." would appear to flicker 
and then a few seconds afterward the application would 
hang/crash (or the crash might happen if the Step Up 
button was clicked while at the end of the document).
* Fixed the action of the checkbox in the Case tab of the 
Preferences dialog that reads "Check here if you want 
Adapt It to automatically distinguish between upper case 
and lower case letters". Previously checking this checkbox 
might fail to take effect until the second time it was 
checked.
* Also adjusted the problem of the Case tab in Preferences 
not sizing properly when the list boxes have data in them 
(hiding some buttons at bottom).
* Fixed Ctrl+O hot key on Linux version, and assigned 
Ctrl+Shift+O hot key to invoke Start Working... wizard on 
Linux version.
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.2
----------------------------------------------
* Added Menu short cut keys for the Advanced and Layout 
menus.
* Focus now moves to the New Translation edit box of the 
Choose Translation dialog if the last Translation in the 
list box is removed.
* Navigation text now displays "end fn" to mark the last 
source word of a footnote.

Version 4.1.1 update 28Feb2009:
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.1
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in the KB Editor that was causing a program 
crash when removing an existing translation string from 
the list of translations for a given source phrase.
* Changed the layout of buttons in some dialogs to allow 
configuration of OK and Cancel buttons to reverse their 
relative positions as required for the Mac port. This 
change has minimal impact on the Windows and Linux 
versions.
* Choose Translation dialog now has a short-cut key for 
jumping to the "New Translation" edit box, and implements 
cyclical up/down arrow key selection (for Windows and 
Mac - Linux implementation is only partial)
* Macintosh pre-release version: Fixes a number of Mac 
look-and-feel issues and source text selection issues.

Version 4.1.0 update 31Jan2009:
----------------------------------------------
Feature changes and new features in 4.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* Sil Converters is now implemented in the Windows port. 
SIL Converters must first be installed on the computer to 
enable Adapt It's Tools Menu and Advanced Menu items 
related to SIL Converters. See SIL Converters 
documentation for more information.
* The TU elements in the Knowledge Base XML files are now 
sorted. Some users requested this change to make 
Subversion backups more efficient.
* The Knowledge Base Editor now shows only the "All Gloss 
Words Or Phrases" tab while Glossing is active.
* Previously, the Knowledge Base Editor would not show a 
source phrase entry in its lists if the source phrase 
reference count was only 1 before the phrase box is 
placed at that location. In such cases, to examine a 
source phrase whose reference count was 1, the user had to 
first move the phrase box to a different location and 
select the source word/phrase desired for lookup, before 
invoking the KB Editor. Now, the source phrase appearing 
in the phrase box will be looked up, and found in the KB 
Editor even if its reference count was 1 before the KB 
Editor was invoked.
* The Knowledge Base Editor now automatically looks up 
the source phrase at the current location of the phrase 
box, unless the user has selected a different source 
phrase at another location in the text at the time the 
Knowledge Base Editor is invoked.
* The "Check Knowledge Base" selection was removed from 
the File menu. It was not really needed and only served 
to make project loading take longer.
* Added "Please wait..." dialog for project loading at 
the project page. The saving of KBs was optimized for 
speed resulting in shorter wait times when opening a 
project with very large KBs.
* Change the Restore Knowledge Base functionality so 
that it avoids trying to set the adaptations to their 
punctuation-containing forms. This prevents any 
punctuation-placement dialogs from opening during the 
restore operation - a useful thing to do because such 
dialogs have no useful purpose during restoration of 
the knowledge base.
* In the event of an error loading an XML adaptation 
document, the name of the file being loaded now appears 
in the title bar of the message box.
* The Adapt It Reference.doc includes a more complete 
description of the enhanced Edit Source Text process 
and Adapt It's "vertical editing" process that assists 
in the process.
----------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in 4.1.0
----------------------------------------------
* The Go To... dialog and many other dialogs now 
default to the OK button when the user presses Enter.
* Fixes the problem of pegging the CPU usage at near 
100% while Adapt It is running. Now Adapt It should 
use less than 1% when the application is running but 
sitting in an idle state.
* Fixes a problem in which the View Filtered Material 
dialog would not size properly if the list of 
standard format markers had many markers in it.
* Fixes a possible spurious error message that can 
appear when the WX version reads a legacy project 
configuration file and the user sets up Auto 
Capitalization in the Case page of the Preferences 
dialog.
* Fixes incorrect double-click behavior of the 
"Translations..." listbox in the Choose Translation 
dialog. Before the fix a double-click might result in 
the wrong list item being entered, or the dialog 
closing with nothing happening.
* Fixes incorrect behavior of the "Accept 
<no adaptation> for this item" button and the "Ignore 
it, I will fix it later" button in the "Inconsistency 
Found" dialog which can pop up in the event of an 
inconsistency during a Consistency Check... selection 
(from the Edit menu). The bug was causing these two 
buttons to be the same as pressing the dialog's "Cancel" 
button.
* Fixes a bug in vertical editing that resulted in the 
Choose Translation dialog appearing twice, the first 
time with none of the controls initialized, the second 
time with initialization done twice and so the list 
box had the entries doubled.
* Fixes the following bug: in vertical edit, with 
glosses being done before adaptations, the phrase box 
was not programmatically returned to the start of the 
editable span in the adaptations line.
* Ubuntu Intrepid: Fixed the program hang/crash 
problem that occurred when opening the Help Topics 
item on the Help menu in the Linux port under Ubuntu 
Intrepid.
* Fixed another bug in the Knowledge Base Editor where 
look ups of source phrases composed of two or more 
merged words could sometimes result in duplicate 
entries in the Source Phrase list box.
* Fixes a bug in opening the Knowledge Base Editor 
from a source text selection, the item highlighted in 
the dialog's Source Phrase list might turn out to be 
the first item in the list, rather than the one the 
user selected in the main window.
* Fixes the following bug: if the user inserted a 
placeholder before a word or phrase where standard 
format markers were stored, and later did a source text 
standard format export, then the SF markers at that 
location would not be included in the exported data.
* Fixes a bug in the KB Export function that failed to 
insert end-of-line characters into the exported KB file 
(Unicode version only - the ANSI version did not have 
the problem).
* Fixes the following bug: if the user selected source 
text which begins with an SF marker, such as \q for 
'poetry', and in the Edit Source Text dialog removes 
all the selection but just leaves the \q marker in the 
box, the final result is that there is a white space 
gap in the text where the marker is stored (an 
underlying storage element with no content except the 
marker). What the user expects is that the marker will 
attach to the first word following the former selection 
- and that is now what happens.
* Fixes the following bug introduced at version 4: if 
the source text contained two or more words in a merger 
and there was punctuation medially within the phrase, 
if the user did a File / Restore Knowledge Base 
operation, when the Place Phrase-Medial Punctuation 
dialog came up, the target text shown in the dialog was 
not the correct text, it was just whatever contents the 
phrase box had when the restore operation was invoked.

Version 4.0.4 update 13Dec2008:

* Better detection of the default documents working 
directory's actual location. For example, if on a Windows 
system, the user has "moved" the location of the 
"My Documents" folder (on Windows XP) or the "Documents" 
folder (on Vista), by right clicking on the default folder, 
selecting "Properties" and the "Move..." button and selects 
a new "destination" for "My Documents" (or "Documents"), 
this version should detect more acurately the change of 
location for these system folders, and establish/look for 
its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder in that new location.
* Fixes a long-standing bug in the Mac version that 
prevented scrolling from working correctly. This bug fix 
will allow the Mac port to move forward toward a release 
in early 2009.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.3 update 26Nov2008:

* About dialog now displays the date of the current release 
as well as the current version number.
* Documentation files edited and updated.

Version 4.0.2 update 22Nov2008:

* Source Text Editing ("vertical editing") is more fully 
implemented and should be more robust.
* Fixes a program hang that would happen if the computer's 
system language was set to something other than English and 
not a language that has an existing localization. This was 
reported by a user whose system language was set to Dutch, 
and the Default choice in the Choose Interface Language... 
dialog wrongly showed Dutch as the default first choice. 
But Dutch does not infact exist as an interface language 
choice, so the program encountered problems resulting in a 
program hang.
* Fixes a number of problems that can occur if a project 
configuration file refers to a font name that does not 
exist on the current local machine (which might happen when 
migrating data to a different computer or platform). When 
the configuration file is read in, Adapt It will substitute 
a system font for any unknown font referred to in the 
project configuration file and notify the user of the 
action taken. The user would then need to insure that the 
appropriate font was installed, and/or select the 
appropriate font from the Fonts tab of the Preferences... 
dialog from the Edit menu.
* Fixes the bottleneck that was causing the KBEditor to 
take too much time to populate the key string list box 
when there are many hundreds or thousands of entries in 
the list box.
* Updates the AI_USFM.xml style control file to reflect 
the new USFM 2.2 changes made by UBS on 17Oct2008.

Version 4.0.1 update 28Oct2008:

* Fixes a potential crash problem in the source text 
editing's vertical edit process. 
* Adds sanity checks to insure that valid selections are 
made in a number of list box controls. 
* Makes adjustments to the sizers in a number of the 
larger dialogs and the wizard to better fit on the 
smaller 800 x 600 pixel screens being used on the new 
generation of mini notebook computers. 
* Updates the documentation for version 4. 
* Makes a few changes to the localization files. This is 
the first version advertised to the user community.

New WX Version 4.0.0 initial release 16Oct2008:

Adapt It WX is an entirely new version of Adapt It based 
on the wxWidgets Cross-Platform GUI Library. This new 
version of Adapt It is no longer dependent on Microsoft's 
MFC programming framework, nor does it utilize the .NET 
Framework, but is now independent of Microsoft's 
proprietary technologies in order to become a truly 
cross-platform application. See the "Known Issues and 
Limitations.txt" file for information on how this 
cross-platform version differs from previous legacy 
versions.

(See the legacy version 3.6.4 for changes prior to this 
new release of Adapt It WX)
