<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is normally hidden from view. It can 
only be shown and accessed under password control. To make the Administrator 
menu visible you can select the <strong>Show Administrator Menu</strong> menu 
item from the View menu. To initially show the Administrator menu you will need 
to use the <a href="#default_password">default password</a>. Once you have 
access to the Administrator menu&nbsp;you can assign a personalized password for 
accessing the Administrator menu, however, the <a 
href="#default_password">default password</a> will always work to make the 
Administrator menu visible at any time.</p>
<p>                  
             
     The Adapt It team highly recommends that you 
take advantage of the Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful 
setup can make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and 
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> .</p>

<h2><a name="adaptit_projects_vs_pt_or_be_projects"></a>Adapt It Projects versus 
Paratext or Bibledit Projects</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Some of the discussion about 
establishing connections between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit projects may 
be confusing if you are not aware of the different approaches these translation 
applications have to translation projects. Both Paratext and Bibledit 
consider&nbsp;a project to involve the creation of a translation in only 
<strong>one</strong> language. These applications may bring in translation 
resources such as Bible translations in other languages to assist the human 
translator. Each translation resource is&nbsp;stored in a&nbsp;single Paratext 
or Bibledit project.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span 
style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Since Adapt It partially automates 
the translation process it involves the use of <b 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">two</i></b> languages in its 
projects:</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Because Adapt It works with a 
minimum of two languages, collaboration requires the development of at least 
<strong>two</strong> projects in Paratext or Bibledit for each Adapt It 
project:</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span

Adapt It.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span 
style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">In addition, since Adapt It has 
the ability to create free translations, you may&nbsp;want to create another 
empty Paratext or Bibledit project to receive the free translations. 
</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span 
style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Collaboration between Adapt It and 
either Paratext or Bibledit means that the strengths of both translation 
applications are available to the translator in a relatively seamless process. 
When collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It creates and maintains its 
own projects in project folders - just as it did in previous versions of Adapt 
It. But when collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt 
It&nbsp;automatically handles the transfer of&nbsp;source texts from Paratext or 
Bibledit to its&nbsp;Adapt It's own&nbsp;project and automatically handles the 
transfer of adapted/target texts (and free translations) back to the appropriate 
Paratext or Bibledit projects, where they can be revised, checked and polished 
in Paratext or Bibledit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">One other difference between Adapt 
It and&nbsp;the other programs&nbsp;is that Adapt It is stores documents at the 
chapter or book level.&nbsp;Paratext stores documents at the book level only. 
Bibledit stores documents at the chapter level only. The collaboration process 
knows about this difference and is able to accommodate it. However, it does have 
implication for the planning process by the administrator. You need to plan 
ahead in determining what books are to be translated</span> and the approach you 
want to use. The AI team recommends that you use a chapter by chapter approach 
consistently. Therefore working in collaboration uses the chapter by chapter 
approach by default. This means that, although Adapt It uses&nbsp;smaller 
units&nbsp;in&nbsp;its own&nbsp;AI project, collaboration mode keeps the 
Paratext texts in book units, and the Bibledit texts in their chapter units.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus any organization method is supported. However, once you 
decide to use a book or a chapter as an adaptation unit you should keep using 
that unit throughout the the work in a project. For a given book, you should not 
do adaptation work part of the time using the whole book approach&nbsp;and part 
of the time using a chapter by chapter approach.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Automatically" ></a>Automatically 
exchange Scripture files with Paratext or       Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> . Here are the steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>
<h3>1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It (6.1.0) and Paratext (7.1 
or newer) are installed</h3>       
   </h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For Adapt It to collaborate 
with Paratext, you need to <strong>install version 7.1 or 
newer of Paratext and version 6.1.0 or newer of Adapt 
It</strong> . The most 
recent Windows version of Adapt It&nbsp;is&nbsp;available at&nbsp;<a 
href="http://adapt-it.org.">http://adapt-it.org.</a> If your version of Adapt It is not 
at least 6.1.0 or newer, you will need to 
download and install it.</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext, you should ensure that Paratext has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up -- one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. (You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>.) The source project needs to have completed texts, either 
imported from a source or completed in Paratext. You need to include <em>all 
</em> texts&nbsp;that&nbsp;are to be translated in the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project(s) that are to receive the translation draft (and free 
translation, if desired) need to be established as well. These projects need to 
contain "empty" books which include the chapter and verse USFM markers. There 
needs to be an empty book to correspond to each of the books in the source 
project. The USFM markers are necessary for&nbsp;Adapt It to properly place the 
draft translations.</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 419px; HEIGHT: 415px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=419 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/PTNewProject.gif" width=400 height=381 ></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and Settings"&nbsp; 
      dialog</p></td></tr>
  </table></p>
<p><br> As you create the projects it 
 is important to ensure that 
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly in Paratext's 
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong>         dialog&nbsp;for 
each Paratext project in the&nbsp;Adapt It&nbsp;collaboration. The <strong>Language</strong> setting in the above dialog where the 
Paratext language of the "source" and "target" 
(and "free translation") this setting in the projects allows Adapt It to create 
the collaboration project name. (See below) Press the 
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New...</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a unique&nbsp;language 
name for each project.&nbsp;Paratext provides you with a small set of defined 
languages and if&nbsp;one of your languages is not in the defined list, you can 
establish a new one by pressing the <strong>New...</strong>     
button. Therefore, if the&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;project&nbsp;has the objective of 
translating&nbsp;<strong>Swahili</strong> texts to 
<strong>English</strong>,&nbsp;the "source" project's <strong>Language</strong> 
field should be set to <strong>Swahili</strong>. In the same way, 
the&nbsp;"target texts" project's <strong>Language</strong> field should be set 
to <strong>English</strong>.<strong> </strong>You may need to establish Swahili as a "new" language; however, English 
is             
            
               
   a&nbsp; Paratext predefined language. Free translation projects should be in the 
same language as the target project.</p>
<h3>3. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p>The next step is to set up the collaboration in Adapt 
It. This process takes place using the <strong>Administrator</strong>      menu.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width=300 height=240 >  </p>
<p align="left"> When you select "Setup Paratext Collaboration..." the 
following dialog appears:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 407px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=389 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/SetupPTCollabNoLangNamesCtrls.gif" width=550 
      height=391></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up Paratext Collaboration" 
  dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p> <br>You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on 
this dialog:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<div>&nbsp;Before doing any other setup you 
must <strong>verify that the Paratext projects have already been created within 
Paratext</strong>             
      . A minimum of at least two 
Paratext projects are required: One Paratext project for obtaining source texts 
for adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different Paratext project to receive 
the adapted texts produced by Adapt It. If the user wants to create a 
"free translation" in addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third Paratext 
project set up to receive free translations.</div>
<p dir="ltr">The Paratext projects need to have ALL of the books that are to be adapted in the overall project.&nbsp;This 
means that&nbsp;you need to import every book&nbsp;into the Paratext&nbsp;source text project. In 
the Paratext project that is to receive adapted texts, you should 
<strong>create</strong> the same set of books as             
   in the source Paratext project. When creating books in the 
Paratext projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but&nbsp;<strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong>             
             
           
             
              
              
    (the Paratext default).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">            Each line in the list displays 
a single Paratext project.&nbsp;List lines have up to four parts separated by colon characters (:). 
The first part is the Paratext "Short Name". The second part is the 
Paratext "Full Name" for that project. The third part is the "Language" name. 
The fourth part&nbsp;(if it has been defined within Paratext) is the 
code for that project. Important: If you do not see the expected projects, you should STOP 
at this point in the Adapt It setup. Cancel from the Setup Adapt It Collaboration dialog,&nbsp;and 
go back to Paratext to do the necessary setup. You will not be able 
to complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary 
Paratext projects&nbsp;exist.</p>

 <li>
  <p>
<div> Once you have ensured that the necessary Paratext 
  projects have been created, you need to <strong>select at 
  least two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong> 
  shown in step 2. Click on the first "Select from List" button and select the 
  Paratext project from which source texts will be obtained during 
  collaboration. Then click on the second "Select from List" button and 
  select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;Paratext project which is to receive translation 
  drafts during collaboration. If you have set up a third Paratext project to 
  receive free translations, use the third button to select that project. The 
  Paratext projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of the 
  "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
  receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
  "No Free Translation" button. <br><br 
  >The "Password protect collaboration 
  switching" check box is ticked by default. When ticked a user must enter a 
  password to change the projects used in collaboration that are set up here in 
  this dialog. Once collaboration has been set up, the user will only see the 
  "Get Source Text from Paratext Project" dialog (see below). On that dialog is 
  a button labeled "Change Paratext Projects". While the "Password protect 
  collaboration switching" check box is ticked here in this dialog (it is ticked 
  by default), it protects the "Change Paratext Projects" button in that user 
  dialog so that the user wouldn't be able to           
              
    accidentally change the collaboration projects. If a user may ever 
have legitimate need to change the projects, there is a defaul password you 
can give the user that will always work for switching projects 
at the user level. It is the word "switch" 
(without the quote marks). If&nbsp;the default password switch is not suitable,&nbsp;you can 
set up a custom password for the user&nbsp;for such purposes. You can 
click on&nbsp;the "Set password for collaboration switching..." button to create a&nbsp;unique custom&nbsp;password. Note: In 
addition to the default password (switch), the general administrative password (admin) will 
always work too, but you should not give the general administrative 
password to your users.</div>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>When Adapt It works in collaboration with Paratext, 
  it not only transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext projects 
  -- it also maintains its own collaboration project in the computer's "Adapt It 
  Unicode Work" folder (or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode version). 
  Once the languages have been defined, Adapt It assumes that its collaboration 
  project should be named using the defined languages. Therefore in our example, 
  Adapt It&nbsp;would name the project&nbsp;"<strong 
  >Swahili to English adaptations.</strong> " When setting 
  up for collaboration, if Adapt It finds a project that already exists by that 
  name, it does its work in that project. However, if Adapt It does not find a 
  project by that name, it creates a new one by that name in the Adapt It work 
  folder ("Adapt It Unicode Work" in the Unicode version, or "Adapt It Work" in 
  the non-Unicode version). 
  <p></p>
  <p>If the the Adapt It project has already been 
  established and work has already been done in the two languages, the 
  collaboration project can take advantage of the previously 
  developed&nbsp;project knowledge base. The collaboration project continues to 
  develop the knowledge base. You should be aware however that you can not 
  continue to work on previously created documents while Adapt It is in 
  collaboration mode. Collaboration mode must turned off to work in standard 
  Adapt It documents.</p>
  <p>Adapt It uses the selected projects&nbsp;to 
  automatically select any current Adapt It project having a name based on the 
  two languages. Adapt It then selects the project listed in the drop down box. 
  If there is no appropriately named project name, Adapt It creates a new 
  project with a name based on the selected&nbsp;Language fields specified in 
  the projects and lists the new project in the drop down box. If, for some 
  reason,&nbsp;the name&nbsp;Adapt It selects is not suitable, you&nbsp;may 
  select <strong>&lt;Create a new project 
  instead&gt;</strong> from the drop down box -- in which case edit 
  boxes&nbsp;appear in which you can specify the names to be used for the source 
  and target languages of a new Adapt It project.</p>
  <li>Finally, <strong>click on the 
  radio button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong 
  >OK</strong> button. This activates the 
  collaboration&nbsp;between Adapt It and&nbsp;Paratext. In a few seconds you 
  should see the&nbsp;following main&nbsp;dialog: 
  <p></p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width="500" height="259" ></p>
  <p>From this simple dialog the user can select a 
  Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It 
  automatically fetches the source text and any existing target text from 
  Paratext, and displays them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the 
  adaptation process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically 
  transfers the saved work back to the appropriate Paratext projects.</p>
  <p>As the dialog shows, the user can select to work 
  either by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default and 
  recommended method of work for collaborating with Paratext. Working by whole 
  book is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is OK, 
  but a user should work chapter by chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
  work by whole book one day and chapter by chapter on another day. The method 
  of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole 
  book.</p></li> </ol>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and 
then moving the results to Paratext&nbsp;involved a lot of manual work 
--&nbsp;copying and joining&nbsp;chapter files together into whole books and 
copying them back and forth between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Adapt 
It knows how to handle the consolidation of books into&nbsp;chapters 
and&nbsp;how to break books into chapters. All the details and&nbsp;organization 
of files are&nbsp;processed&nbsp;behind the scenes&nbsp;and &nbsp;invisible to 
the user. During collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in 
the computer's file system and never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that 
have been established in the Paratext projects. The "Select a chapter" list 
shows each chapter that is available for collaboration work. The chapter list 
also indicates the "Target Text&nbsp;Status" for each chapter. The text box 
under the lists also gives more details about the status of a selected 
chapter.</p>
<h3>4. Adapt It -- Paratext collaboration remains in effect 
until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Paratext if you want to do so by using the same Setup 
Paratext Collaboration dialog and clicking the&nbsp;Collaboration OFF radio 
button. Any documents created while collaboration&nbsp;was ON are still 
available in the Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt 
It reverts to using its Start Working Wizard for selecting projects and 
documents by name. Adapt It remembers the settings you made while collaboration 
was on, and if you later decide to turn collaboration ON again, all 
that&nbsp;you need to do is to click on the Collaboration ON radio button. 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important thing is to remember that Adapt It can 
work in both Collaborative and traditional modes but these modes are mutually 
exclusive. You have to use only one of the modes at a time. It an Adapt 
It&nbsp;user needs to work part of the time doing collaboration on Scripture 
files, and part of the time on other Adapt It projects that do not involve 
collaboration, you can easily set up desktop launcher icons that you can 
configure to use command-line switches/options which will enable that launcher 
to start up Adapt It with collaboration ON or OFF, and also specify which 
Paratext projects are to be used for the given session. Multiple launchers can 
be configured to handle each type of work session, so that all the user needs to 
do is to launch the Adapt It icon that he needs to do the particular work needed 
for that session. See the section "<a href="#setting_up_desktop_launchers" >Setting Up

<h3>1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It 
(6.1.0) and&nbsp;d&nbsp;(4.3 or newer) are installed</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For 
Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit, you need to <strong>install version 6.1.0 or newer of Adapt It and version 4.3 
or newer of Bibledit-gtk</strong>.&nbsp;The current version of Adapt It packaged 
in the SIL repositories can handle collaboration. Getting a version 
of&nbsp;Bibledit is more difficult. The versions packaged in the&nbsp;standard 
Ubuntu repositories (through Onerirc), are not new enough&nbsp;to handle 
collaboration (typically they have version 4.0 or older).&nbsp;The SIL <a 
href="http://packages.sil.org">packages.sil.org</a> 
repository has a version of Bibledit (4.2.67) for Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, Natty 
and Oneiric but that version&nbsp;is still does not support collaboration with 
Adapt It.&nbsp;Until the official Ubuntu repositories get a newer version of 
Bibledit, the Bibledit team has made newer versions of Bibledit available in the 
CrossWire repository. Therefore, in order to be able to get Adapt It and 
Bibledit to collaborate together,&nbsp;you will need to ensure that your 
Software Sources have the necessary repositories listed in their "Other 
Software" settings. Do the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Start 
up&nbsp;<strong>Synaptic Package Manager. </strong>It 
should be located in the System&nbsp;&gt; Administration menu (If it is not 
there or you are using Unity, which doesn't install it by default,&nbsp;you can 
find&nbsp;the Synaptic Package Manager by clicking on "Ubuntu Software 
Center".&nbsp;In the Ubuntu Software Center's Search box type "Synaptic", then 
click on the "Synaptic Package Manager" item when it appears and click on 
"Install").</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> In the Synaptic 
Package Manager application click on the <strong>Settings 
&gt; Repositories</strong>. Click on the "<strong>Other 
Software</strong>" tab. Examine the list of software repositories. If there is 
not already a line that contains a reference to <strong>http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;...</strong>, then 
click on the "Add..." button at the bottom. Then enter <strong>one</strong> of the following lines depending on which 
distribution of Ubuntu Linux is installed on your machine:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu lucid main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu maverick main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;natty main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu oneiric 
main</strong></font> </p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Close the 
Software Sources, and return to the Synaptic Package Manager, <strong>click on "Reload"</strong> to insure you have the latest 
information from the repositories. If you get an error, check that you have 
entered the correct line into your Other Software (step b above).</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Click on the 
"Search" button and type <strong>adaptit</strong> in the 
search box. When the&nbsp;adaptit packages appear, look&nbsp;at the "Installed 
Version" and "Latest Version" columns. Ensure that the version listed for 
adaptit is <strong>at least 6.1.0</strong>. If the "Latest 
Version" (if no version of adaptit is at least 6.1.0 make sure you have set up 
the http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu line correctly in the Synaptic Package 
Manager's Software Sources setup in step b above). If no version is listed in 
the "Installed Version", or if the "Latest Version" is newer than&nbsp;the 
"Installed Version" listed you should mark the adaptit is entries for 
installation or upgrade. To mark the adaptit and adaptit-docs packages, right 
click on them and select "Mark for Installation" or "Mark for Upgrade" from the 
popup menu. Select the "Mark" button in the warning dialog. Then click on the 
"Apply" button at the top of the Synaptic Package Manager application, and click 
on the "Apply" button on the Summary dialog. Close Synaptic Package Manager 
after it completes the installation of Adapt It.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> <strong>Close the Synaptic Package Manager</strong> and open a 
Terminal. In the terminal type the following&nbsp;commands:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu<br></strong><strong>sudo apt-get 
update<br>sudo apt-get install bibledit-gtk</strong></font> 
</p>
<p>After their installation, both Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Bibledit-Gtk should be listed in the Office menu (or can be found by 
searching for adaptit or bibledit on Unity's DeskHome search bar). The next step 
is to ensure that you have your Bibledit projects (at least two) setup within 
Bibledit.</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up 
Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit, you should ensure that Bibledit has at 
least <strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project 
for obtaining <strong>source</strong> texts, and a 
different project to receive the <strong>translation 
drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to have a third project 
set up within Bibledit for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong> . These projects should be set up, complete with books 
either imported or created within Bibledit <strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to collaborate with 
Bibledit. Select File &gt; Project &gt; New to access Bibledit's "Project 
properties" dialog. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 412px; HEIGHT: 352px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=412 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BENewProject.gif" width="400" height="318" ></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Bibledit "Project properties" 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p align="left">Note: You can ignore the Language setting 
field shown above during the setup for collaboration. If you know how to set up 
a customized Bibledit language name you can do so; but because of the difficulty 
for most users, Adapt It does not make use of&nbsp;the "Language" setting here 
in the Bibledit Project's&nbsp;properties dialog. Instead Adapt It&nbsp;will ask 
you in step 2 below for the language names it will use&nbsp;for the Bibledit 
projects participating in&nbsp;the collaboration process.</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long 
term goal in mind when creating the Bibledit projects and the books for those 
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the 
Bibledit project used for source texts ALL books that may eventually be adapted 
using Adapt It. In the Bibledit project that is to receive adapted texts, you 
should <strong>create</strong> &nbsp;ALL the books that may 
ever be translated now at the beginning of the project. When creating books in 
the Bibledit projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but <strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong> (the Bibledit default).</p>
<h3>3. Set Up Adapt It - Bibledit Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupBECollab.gif" width="300" height="240" > </p>
<p align="left">When you select "Setup Bibledit 
Collaboration..." the following dialog appears:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 390px; HEIGHT: 353px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=390 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/SetUpBibleditCollaboration.gif" width="600" height="363" ></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up&nbsp;Bibledit 
      Collaboration" dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p><br>You should follow the 4 
numbered steps as shown on this dialog:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <div>Before doing any other setup you must <strong 
  >verify that the Bibledit projects have already been 
  created within Bibledit</strong> . A minimum of at least two Bibledit projects 
  are required: One Bibledit project for obtaining source texts for adaptation 
  work in Adapt It; and a different Bibledit project to receive the adapted 
  texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free translation in 
  addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third Bibledit project set up to 
  receive free translations.</div>
  <div>Each line in the list displays a single Bibledit 
  project. Whatever you assign as "Name" in the Bibledit project properties will 
  be shown in the above dialog. Important: If you do not see the projects listed 
  that your user will need to use in collaboration, you should STOP at this 
  point in the Adapt It setup. Cancel from the Setup Bibledit Collaboration 
  dialog and do the necessary setup of the Bibledit projects first. You will not 
  be able to complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary 
  Bibledit projects already exist.</div>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>
  <div>Once you have ensured that the necessary Bibledit 
  projects have been created, you need to <strong>select at 
  least two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong> 
  shown in step 2. Click on the first "Select from List" button and select the 
  Bibledit project from which source texts will be obtained during 
  collaboration. Adapt It will then display this dialog asking you for the name 
  of the source language:</div>
  <div align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Enter_src_lang_name_dlgBE.gif" width="300" height="102" > </div>
  <div>Enter the language name of the source language of 
  the project you just selected to obtain source texts. Then click on the second 
  "Select from List" button and select a different Bibledit project which is to 
  receive translation drafts during collaboration. Adapt It will then display 
  another dialog asking you for the name of the target language:</div>
  <div align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Enter_tgt_lang_name_dlgBE.gif" width="300" height="102" > </div>
  <div align="left">Enter the language name of the target 
  language of the project you just selected to receive translation drafts. If 
  you have set up a third Bibledit project to receive free translations, use the 
  third button to select that project. The Bibledit projects selected will 
  appear in the dialog to the left of the "Select from List" buttons. If you 
  accidentally selected a project for receiving free translations, you can clear 
  that project's selection using the "No Free Translation" button.<br 
  ><br>The "Password protect 
  collaboration switching" check box is ticked by default. When ticked a user 
  must enter a password to change the projects used in collaboration that are 
  set up here in this dialog. Once collaboration has been set up, the user will 
  only see the "Get Source Text from Bibledit Project" dialog (see below). On 
  that dialog is a button labeled "Change Bibledit Projects". While the 
  "Password protect collaboration switching" check box is ticked here in this 
  dialog (it is ticked by default), it protects the "Change Bibledit Projects" 
  button in that user dialog so that the user wouldn't be able to accidentally 
  change the collaboration projects. If a user may ever have legitimate need to 
  change the projects, there is a defaul password you can give the user that 
  will always work for switching projects at the user level. It is the word 
  "switch" (without the quote marks). If the default password switch is not 
  suitable, you can set up a custom password for the user for such purposes. You 
  can click on the "Set password for collaboration switching..." button to 
  create a unique custom password. Note: In addition to the default password 
  (switch), the general administrative password (admin) will always work too, 
  but you should not give the general administrative password to your 
  users.</div>
  <p></p>
  <li>
  <div>
  <p>Adapt It automatically enters any Adapt It project 
  that it knows about based on the&nbsp;language names you entered for 
  the&nbsp;projects selected for obtaining source texts and for receiving 
  translation drafts. If Adapt It has been used previously for the same 
  languages, it will hook up to the project listed in the drop down box during 
  collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used previously for the same language 
  pair, it will create a new Adapt It project by the name in the drop down box. 
  If no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, you may select &lt;Create a 
  new project instead&gt; from the drop down box - in which case edit boxes will 
  appear in which you can specify the names to be used for the source and target 
  languages that will make up the name of a new Adapt It project. When Adapt It 
  works in collaboration with Bibledit, it not only transfers data between Adapt 
  It and the selected Bibledit projects - it also maintains its own project in 
  the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder.</p></div>
  <li>
  <div>Finally, <strong>click on the 
  radio button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong 
  >OK</strong> button. This activates the collaboration 
  between Adapt It and Bibledit. In a few seconds you should see the following 
  main dialog the user will normally see during collaboration:</div>
  <div align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" width="550" height="300" > 
  </div>
  <div>From this simple dialog the user can select a 
  Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It 
  will automatically fetch the source text and any existing target text from 
  Bibledit - merging them if necessary, and display them in Adapt It's main 
  window, ready to continue the adaptation process. When work is saved within 
  Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers the saved work back to the 
  appropriate Bibledit projects.</div>
  <div>As the dialog shows, the user can select to work 
  either by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default and 
  recommended method of work for collaborating with Bibledit. Working by whole 
  book is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is OK, 
  but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
  work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
  of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole 
  book.</div></li></ol>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and 
then moving the results to&nbsp;Bibledit involved a lot of manual work -- 
copying and joining chapter files together into whole books and copying them 
back and forth between Adapt It and Bibledit. Not any more! Adapt It knows how 
to handle the consolidation of books into chapters and how to break books into 
chapters. All the details and organization of files are processed behind the 
scenes and invisible to the user. During collaboration work the user never needs 
to navigate around in the computer's file system and never needs to find or copy 
or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that 
have been pre-created in the Bibledit projects. The "Select a chapter" list 
shows each chapter that is available for collaboration work. The chapter list 
also indicates the "Chapter status" for each chapter. The text box under the 
lists also gives more details about the status of a selected chapter.</p>
<h3>4. Adapt It - Bibledit collaboration remains in effect 
until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Paratext if you want to do so by using the same 
Setup&nbsp;Bibledit Collaboration dialog and clicking the Collaboration OFF 
radio button. Any documents created while collaboration was ON are still 
available in the Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt 
It reverts to using its Start Working Wizard for selecting projects and 
documents by name. Adapt It remembers the settings you made while collaboration 
was on, and if you later decide to turn collaboration ON again, all that you 
need to do is to click on the Collaboration ON radio button.</p>
<p>The important thing is to remember that Adapt It can 
work in both Collaborative and traditional modes but these modes are mutually 
exclusive. You have to use only one of the modes at a time. It an Adapt It user 
needs to work part of the time doing collaboration on Scripture files, and part 
of the time on other Adapt It projects that do not involve collaboration, you 
can easily set up desktop launcher icons that you can configure to use 
command-line switches/options which will enable that launcher to start up Adapt 
It with collaboration ON or OFF, and also specify which&nbsp;Bibledit projects 
are to be used for the given session. Multiple launchers can be configured to 
handle each type of work session, so that all the user needs to do is to launch 
the Adapt It icon that he needs to do the particular work needed for that 
session. See the section "<a href="#setting_up_desktop_launchers" >Setting Up 
Adapt It Desktop Launchers For Specific Work Scenarios</a> ".</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Setup_User_Workflow_Profile"></a>Set up a User Workflow Profile</h2>
<p>Adapt It has many menu items and features to choose 
from. Such choices may be bewildering to a new user or inexperienced user. Adapt 
It now allows an administrator to control which choices appear in the program's 
interface, and which others remain hidden until such time as they may be needed. 
To activate a user workflow profile, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make 
the&nbsp;Administrator menu visible</a> , then select User Workflow Profiles... 
menu item.&nbsp;The following dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/User_workflow_profiles.gif" width="400" height="429" > </p>
<p>This dialog organizes Adapt It's menu selections, 
Preferences tabs, Mode bar items, and&nbsp;Tool bar items into four lists or 
"profiles"&nbsp;that correspond&nbsp;to the four tabs at the top of the dialog. 
Those tabs or profiles are labeled "Novice", "Experienced", "Skilled" and 
"Custom." The list in each tab all contain the same list of items, but we've 
pre-selected certain items on each list that we think should be visible for that 
profile, and un-selected those items that we think would be good to remain 
hidden for the given profile. The Novice profile starts with most of the listed 
items hidden (un-ticked). The Experienced profile makes a few more items visible 
in the interface (by ticking&nbsp;more items). The Skilled profile makes many 
more interface items visible (by ticking even more items).</p>
<p>Our suggestions are only a starting point; each profile 
can be further customized by you, the administrator, to your liking and 
according to your knowledge of the skills and needs of the user. If you select 
the fourth tab labeled "Custom" Adapt It will ask you if you want to initialize 
the selections from one of the other three profiles as a starting point 
--&nbsp;from which you may continue to customize which interface items are to be 
shown (ticked), and which should be hidden (un-ticked).</p>
<p>The default profile&nbsp;setting is "<strong>None</strong> (keep all menus and settings visible)". If 
you want to use a workflow profile, you first need to click the radio button 
labeled, "<strong>Use a workflow profile</strong> (select 
from drop down list below)". This selection enables the drop down box located 
below it. Only one profile can be selected at a given time for the user. You can 
select the desired profile by using the drop down box which will allow 
you&nbsp;to select the Novice, Experienced, Skilled or the Custom profile. Then, 
to make the interface start using a selected profile click on the "Save Changes" 
button.</p>
<p>At any time you can come back to the User Workflow 
Profiles dialog and switch to a different profile or adjust the individual items 
that should be visible or hidden for a given profile, and save the changes.</p>
<p>If you modified the items in a given profile, and now 
want to revert&nbsp;that profile to its "factory defaults" you can do so by 
first selecting that profile in the drop down box, and then clicking on&nbsp;the 
"Revert to factory defaults" button. If the "Revert to factory defaults" button 
is disabled, it means that you have not changed the viewing status of any 
individual item in that profile's list.</p>
<p>To stop using&nbsp;a user profile, simply click on the 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menu and settings 
visible)" radio button. Adapt It will remember your settings in case you later 
decide to reactivate a workflow profile that you set up previously.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs"></a>Pre-Assign locations for the various kinds of inputs 
and outputs</h2>
<p>Some computer users find it difficult or confusing to 
navigate through a hierarchical file system. They often are not sure where the 
files are located that they need to open, or where to save or export files from 
Adapt It. They may get lost navigating around the file system inside a file 
browser. They may not really know what a file would be called that they are 
looking for, nor what a file should be called when saving or exporting data from 
Adapt It. Adapt It 6 now allows you the administrator to pre-assign locations 
for any and all the kinds of inputs and outputs that can be done by a user. We 
call this a way to "protect" a user from having to do any navigation of the file 
system in order to get his work done.</p>
<p>Adapt It now allows you the administrator, to pre-assign 
locations for Adapt It's inputs and outputs, and therefore protect the user from 
having to compose file names and from having to navigate the file system to find 
or save files. To activate these protections, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make the Administrator 
menu visible</a>, then select the <strong>Assign Locations 
for Inputs and Outputs...</strong> menu item.</p>
<p>If you plan to setup Adapt It to collaborate with 
Paratext or Bibledit you should do that setup step before assigning locations 
for inputs and outputs. If you have Paratext (or Bibledit) installed on the 
user's computer and collaboration has not yet been set up, Adapt It will display 
the following reminder before the main dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Reminder_to_setup_PT_first_before_assigning_locations.gif" width="400" height="148" > 
</p>
<p>After clicking OK, the main dialog appears, which looks 
like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_dlg_nothing_ticked.gif" width="500" height="292" > </p>
<p>In order to set up collaboration with Paratext or 
Bibledit, you need to click <strong>Cancel</strong>&nbsp; 
at this point and go back to the <strong>Administrator</strong> menu to do the collaboration. You 
then can repeat the Assign Locations for Inputs and Outputs process.</p>
<p>By default none of the "Protect from Navigation" check 
boxes are ticked. Each of the names in upper case letters and starting 
with&nbsp;one or two&nbsp;initial _ underscore characters, are the names of a 
standard set of folders that Adapt It 6 automatically creates on the user's 
computer. These folder locations&nbsp; become the default location for the types 
of data described by the folder's names. If you as administrator, wish to 
"protect" that type of data, you can simply put a tick by as many folder 
locations as you want. If you want to protect all the types of data that Adapt 
It uses or exports, simply click on the "Protect All (Check All Boxes)" 
button.</p>
<p>A setup for a fully protected user (with Paratext 
collaboration turned ON) would look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs_all_checked.gif" width="500" height="292" > 
</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It is working in collaboration with 
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically limits the location&nbsp;for 
the&nbsp;source text inputs it obtains for adaptation work, and it also limits 
the locations where translation drafts are exported -- to the Paratext or 
Bibledit projects that are assigned during collaboration.&nbsp; Therefore, if 
you have previously set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, 
the "Protext from Navigation" check boxes to the right of __SOURCE_INPUTS and 
_TARGET_OUTPUTS will indicate (as shown in the dialog immediately 
above)&nbsp;that they are "Using Paratext project"; they will be automatically 
ticked and cannot be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, please understand that if Adapt It is 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, SOURCE texts can only be obtained from 
the Paratext or Bibledit projects, and Adapt It's TARGET texts (adapted 
translation drafts) are automatically transferred&nbsp; back to Paratext or 
Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>However, if your user will <strong>not</strong> be collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, 
you should consider at least selecting the "Protect from Navigation" for the 
__SOURCE_INPUTS folder. When this folder is "protected" the user will only see 
and be able to select from a list of input texts for adaptation that are located 
in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder. This can be a very helpful way to guide the user 
in what texts to use for adaptation. <strong>Since the user 
cannot obtain source text from anywhere else it is important that you, the 
advisor, pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder with the input texts that the user 
will need for his or her adaptation work</strong>. A convenient way to pre-load 
the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder, it to use the "<a href="#Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders" >Move or Copy Files Or 
Folders</a>" dialog from the Administrator menu. This dialog is designed like a 
"smart" file browser and knows what kind of files can be used for adaptation 
work.</p>
<p>When a folder location has "Protect from Navigation" 
activated, Adapt It will not ask the user for a file name nor allow the user to 
navigate to a different folder, but will automatically assign a file name to the 
input or output file, and read it from or store it to the indicated 
location.</p>
<p>The following information is a technical explantion of 
the way Adapt It handles the file naming process. You can safely ignore this 
section unless you are interested in the details or in the unlikely circumstance 
that the file processing does not work properly. In this case, the following 
information can be of value in finding out what went wrong and for conveying to 
the Adapt It what has happened to the computer.</p>
<p>When navigation protection is activated for a given 
input/output type, Adapt It automatically assigns names to files, it composes 
the name based on the type of the file's contents and adds a date-time "stamp" 
at the end of the name, and affixes the appropriate extension. This results in 
some long file names, but that is of no concern to the user, because when 
"Protect from Navigation" is activated the user doesn't have to interact with 
files or file names anyway. For example, the automatically composed name for an 
RTF export of the target text might look something like this:</p><strong>_Target_Text_45_ACT_CH02_exported_2011_07_11T14_25_53Z.rtf</strong> 

<p>and it would be located in the <strong>_TARGET_RTF_OUTPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It 
project. Because of the presence of the date-time stamp within the file name, 
there is never going to be a danger of files overwriting one another because all 
exported files will have unique, easily discernable&nbsp;names, and files with 
similar content will sort together in chronological order.</p>
<p>Note: The assignment of text type prefixes and/or 
date-time stamp suffixes on file names is not automatically done when navigation 
protection is OFF for a given input/output type, but it text type prefixes and 
date-time stamp suffixes can be used if desired at import/export time by ticking 
the appropriate check boxes on the dialog that appears.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the Assign Locations For Inputs 
and Outputs dialog to help keep your user's data organized into predictable 
locations and its files consistently named - so that they are easily identified 
as to content and&nbsp;creation date.</p>
<p>When Adapt It is setup for collaboration with Paratext 
or Bibledit, Adapt It keeps a copy of each chapter or book file that it obtains 
from Paratext/Bibledit - placing the copy in the <strong>__SOURCE_INPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project 
that is hooked up to Paratext/Bibledit during collaboration. The files that 
Adapt It puts in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder are named automatically by Adapt It, 
and will have a _Collab_ prefix on the name.&nbsp;A chapter file for chapter 2 
of the book of Matthew obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar 
to the following example:</p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.txt</strong> 
<p>If collaboration is done by&nbsp;whole book, a&nbsp;file 
obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to the following 
example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.txt</strong> 
</p>
<p>The adaptation documents that Adapt It creates - 
regardless of whether collaboration is ON or OFF, are still stored in the 
"<strong>Adaptations</strong>" folder of the Adapt It 
project. When collaboration is turned ON, those files are automatically named by 
Adapt It. The adaptation document for Matthew chapter 2 would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.xml</strong> </p>
<p>and the adaptation document for the whole book of 
Matthew would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.xml</strong> 
</p>
<p>in either case these xml formatted adaptation 
documents&nbsp;are always&nbsp;located in the <strong>Adaptations</strong> folder of the Adapt It project.</p>

<h2><a name="Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders"></a>Moving or copying files or folders.</h2>
<p>As an administrator you may have a need to move or copy 
files from within Adapt It. Adapt It 6 provides an "intelligent" file browser 
for administrative use. To get Adapt It's file browser, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make the Administrator 
menu visible</a>, then select the "Move Or Copy Folders Or Files..." menu item. 
When you do so the following dual pane dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Move_or_Copy_Folders_or_Files.gif" width="500" height="311" > </p>
<p>Note that generally, if your users are going to be 
working&nbsp;with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, you 
probably do not need to worry about moving or copying files or folders for Adapt 
It's use. In collaboration work the main data you will be concerned about will 
be the data kept in the Paratext or Bibledit data store. In collaboration mode 
Adapt It becomes an adaptation engine for Paratext or Bibledit, and the 
scripture data essentially stays within the Paratext or Bibledit projects. Adapt 
It automatically&nbsp;makes copies of the data and creates its own project for 
the purposes of adaptation, and Adapt It automatically transfers its target 
texts (translation drafts) back to Paratext or Bibledit. Hence, all data is 
destined to start and end within the designated Paratext/Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>The above "intelligent" file browser can be helpful if 
you do not plan to work with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or 
Bibledit. In such cases, you can use this dialog to copy potential source texts 
into an Adapt It project's __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Setting_up_an_administrator_password"></a>Setting up an administrator password</h2>
<p>To access the Administrator menu you first need to make 
the Administrator menu visible. From within Adapt It click on the "Show 
Administrator Menu..." item on the View menu. For the password, you can always 
enter the <a name="default_password"></a>default password 
which is the word admin. You can also set your own password using the 
Administrator menu item for that purpose. The administrator password is not a 
highly guarded secret, but exists only to hinder inexperienced users from 
accessing the administrator menu and changing settings they should not be 
changing. If you set your own password it will be kept unencrypted in the basic 
configuration file AI-BasicConfiguration.aic located in the Adapt It Unicode 
Work folder (or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode application). If you 
forget your password, you can find it in the AI-BasicConfiguration.aic file, or 
you can simply use the default password mentioned above.</p>

<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>What version of Balsa are you using? If you are using 
Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should already have Adapt It 
version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see if there are any recent 
updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x at the&nbsp;packages.sil.org repository. When 
the Lucid version of Balsa boots up, and you log on to the Balsa User account, 
the opening screen looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BalsaOpeningScreen.gif" width="500" height="293" > 
</p>
<p>The Lucid version of Balsa as shown above has Adapt It 
version 5.2.4. You will need Adapt It version 6.x.x in order to take advantage 
of its new features designed for assisting translation program administrators, 
and especially working in collaboration with the Balsa Scripture editor 
Bibledit. The icon for Adapt It version 6 looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ai_new_icon.gif" width="107" height="118" > <br><font face="Arial"><strong>Adapt It</strong></font> </p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
<strong>Advisor</strong> and <strong>Balsa User</strong>. <strong>You as an 
administrator need to log in first as Advisor</strong> to update Adapt It to its 
latest version 6 update which has many new features designed to assist you as an 
administrator. Then, once you have upgraded Adapt It to version 6, you should 
<strong>log off as Advisor</strong> and <strong>log back in as the</strong> <strong>Balsa User</strong> to complete the setup of Adapt It for 
that given user. Except for upgrading Adapt It to the latest version 6.x.x, all 
remaining setup of Adapt It should be done using the Balsa User account.</p>
<p><strong>Note: any data you create 
while logged into the Advisor account in Balsa&nbsp;does NOT appear within Adapt 
It when Balsa is logged into the Balsa User account, and likewise any 
data&nbsp;the user&nbsp;creates within Adapt It under the Balsa User 
account&nbsp;does not appear when logged into the Advisor account.</strong></p>
<p>The steps for doing these things are listed below:</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt 
It to version 6 (if needed)</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Advisor</strong> account in the Balsa system.<br>2. Run the <strong>Synaptic Package 
Manager</strong> by selecting it from the Applications &gt; System menu. In the 
Quick search box type the word adaptit. The "Installed" version of adaptit 
listed there should be at least 6.0.0. If the package manager doesn't indicate 
that version 6.x.x is already installed, you should go ahead and mark it for 
installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card form of Balsa, you probably will 
want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation (although please note 
that&nbsp;the adaptit-docs package&nbsp;is about 11MB of download). <br>3. After you have ensured that Adapt It version 6.x.x is 
installed, you can close the package manager and <strong>log off the Balsa Advisor account</strong>. Next you will 
need to log on to the Balsa User account (see below).</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Balsa 
User</strong> account.<br>2. On the "Work" desktop double 
click on the <strong>Adapt It icon</strong> to start up 
Adapt It.<br>3. Set up the necessary Bibledit projects for 
collaboration. You need at least two Bibledit projects: One for obtaining source 
texts, and one for receiving translation (target text) drafts.<br>4. Access Adapt It's <strong>Administrator menu</strong> (see how to access the 
Administrator menu <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >here</a>).<br>5. After creating the Bibledit projects (step 3), set up 
Adapt it to collaborate with Bibledit (follow the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Bibledit</a> section of this document for 
detailed steps).<br>6. Assign locations for inputs and 
outputs using the dialog for that purpose. It is recommended that you tick all 
of the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes. See <a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs" >this 
section</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<p align="left">If your user(s) will be using Balsa for one 
type of collaboration project you might consider setting up dedicated 
launcher(s) with command-line switches/options that&nbsp;can be used 
to&nbsp;constrain the work session to always start up with collaboration ON with 
specified Paratext or Bibledit projects to be used, or collaboration OFF and a 
non-Scripture AI project pre-selected, etc. Command-line switches and options 
are described <a href="#command_line_switches" >below</a>&nbsp;along with instructions 
for setting up desktop launchers utilizing the command-line 
switches/options.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Setup_custom_work_folder"></a>Set up a custom work folder (Optional)</h2>
<p>For most users you should just allow Adapt It to create 
and maintain its default "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder (or "Adapt It Work" for 
the non-Unicode version) in the default location. For Windows systems, Adapt It 
will by default create this folder in the user's "Documents" (or "My Documents") 
folder. For Linux systems this work folder will be created in the 
/home/&lt;user&gt; folder. On Mac systems this folder will be created in the 
/Users/&lt;user&gt; folder.</p>
<p>In some cases you may want Adapt It to use a custom work 
folder in a non-default location -- such as on a different disk partition, or in 
a different folder than the default location. You can use the Administrator 
menu's "Custom Work Folder..." item to assign the location where Adapt It will 
establish its work folder. When you select "Custom Work Folder", Adapt 
It&nbsp;displays a standard dialog in which you can navigate to the location 
where you want Adapt It to establish its work folder.</p>
<p>Adapt It will remember&nbsp;any custom work 
folder&nbsp;location that you specify --&nbsp;until such time as you, the 
administrator specify a different location or choose "Restore Default Work 
Folder Location" from the Administrator menu. If you establish a custom work 
folder location Adapt It will offer to lock it in that location. If you choose 
not to lock it in that location, Adapt It will only continue using that location 
for the current work session.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that if you create a custom work 
folder and then change back to the default work folder, none of the work done in 
the custom folder transfers to the default folder. The same is true in the other 
direction. You as the administrator are responsible to make those file transfers 
if they are needed. For this reason, the Adapt It team recommends that custom 
work folders are used rarely and if you choose to do so, you use them 
consistently instead of the default folders.</p>

<h2><a name="Guidelines_for_training_users"></a>Guidelines for training Adapt It users</h2>
<h3>Preparations for Collaboration Work (with Paratext or 
Bibledit)</h3>
<p>* <strong>Prepare the 
Paratext/Bibledit projects.</strong> You as Administrator should prepare the 
Paratext/Bibledit projects <strong>BEFORE</strong> setting 
up Adapt It collaboration. You should make sure that <a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start" >Paratext</a> or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Bibledit</a> has <strong>at least TWO projects</strong> :</p>
<p>1. A project that contains the source language texts 
from which Adapt It will obtain its source texts for adaptation work. Preferably 
this Paratext/Bibledit project should contain all the available source texts 
that will be used in collaboration. </p>
<p>2. You also should make sure that Paratext or Bibledit 
has a <strong>different</strong> project created which will 
receive the adapted translation drafts produced by Adapt It. </p>
<p>If your user will be preparing free translations, you 
should also create a third project in Paratext/Bibledit to receive free 
translations. The books you create in the Paratext/Bibledit projects for 
receiving the target text&nbsp;and free translations can be empty but 
they&nbsp;should be created with (empty) chapter and verse numbers. Ensure that 
the (empty) books created correspond to the books that exist in the source 
language project.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup Paratext/Bibledit 
Collaboration.</strong> You as Administrator should setup collaboration using 
the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration..." menu item on the Adapt It 
Administrator menu.&nbsp;Using that Adapt It dialog, designate the 
Paratext/Bibledit project that are to be used, and turn ON collaboration. This 
ensures that the user will not have to do any setup, but can simply start 
working by choosing the book and chapter to work on. After enabling 
collaboration, you should ensure that things are working correctly by selecting 
a scripture book and a chapter from the "Get Source Text from Paratext/Bibledit 
Project dialog". If you get any errors, see the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration" >Trouble Shooting</a> topic.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup a user workflow 
profile.</strong> You as Administrator should carefully consider the skill and 
experience of&nbsp;the user, and determine if one of Adapt It's pre-configured 
<a href="#Setup_User_Workflow_Profile" >user workflow profiles</a> would be 
appropriate&nbsp;for&nbsp;a given&nbsp;user. You can establish a user profile 
using the Administrator menu's "User Workflow Profiles..." menu item. The 
<strong>Novice</strong> user profile hides most menu items 
and options that are not absolutely necessary for basic adaptation work. The 
<strong>Experienced</strong> and <strong>Skilled</strong> profiles enable more menu items and 
interface options. You can also customize any of the profiles or design your own 
profile using the <strong>Custom</strong> user profile. If 
you decide to use a profile, you should practice using Adapt It yourself with 
that profile in force, or at least closely watch the user working with that user 
profile in effect, to make sure that the options that remain visible&nbsp;are 
suitable for the skills and the work expected of that user. You don't want to 
hide options that a user really will need to do his job.</p>
<p>* <strong>Assign Locations for 
Inputs and Outputs.</strong> During collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, 
Adapt It automatically limits the locations for source text inputs and target 
text outputs to the Paratext or Bibledit project being used in collaboration. 
But, Adapt It is able to do other kinds of inputs and exports. You as 
Administrator, should decide whether your user should be "protected" from the 
possibility of getting inputs from the wrong place, and exporting outputs to the 
wrong place. Without such protection files can get lost or misplaced. We suggest 
that you&nbsp;select all of the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes in the "<a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs" >Assign Locations for 
Inputs and Outputs</a>" dialog. When the "Protect from Navigation" check box is 
ticked, Adapt It will automatically name and locate files for that particular 
type of input or output, placing the files within Adapt It's special 
folders.</p>
<p>* <strong>Check the settings in 
Adapt It's Preferences dialog.</strong> The Preferences dialog is accessible 
from the <strong>Edit </strong>menu with a document loaded 
for collaboration. You as Administrator should ensure that Adapt It is 
using&nbsp;the correct <strong>Fonts</strong>, <strong>Punctuation</strong>, and any <strong>Case equivalences</strong>&nbsp;for the languages involved 
in the collaboration work. Use the tabs in the Preferences dialog to make any 
needed changes.</p>
<h3>Training points for Collaboration Work (with Paratext 
or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>Once you have done the necessary preparations as 
described in the "Preparations for Collaboration Work" section above, you should 
provide some supervised training in the use of Adapt It. Your training should 
include the following:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;<strong>Supervised 
"hands-on" adaptation work with the actual texts of the collaboration 
project.</strong> There is a document supplied with Adapt It installations 
called "Adapt It Tutorial.doc". Chapter 1 of that Tutorial contains information 
that is focused on situations where&nbsp;Adapt It is set up to work with texts 
apart from collaboration scenarios. It covers information that you as 
administrator might find helpful, but the user will not need to understand to 
work in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit. However, chapter 2&nbsp;of the 
Adapt It Tutorial.doc is called "Working on a document", and contains good 
information and exercises. You will want to adapt the&nbsp;information 
and&nbsp;procedures demonstrated there to your actual collaboration texts. 
Hence, you should help the user practice using actual texts in the collaboration 
project&nbsp;until s/he feels comfortable working with Adapt It. The knowledge 
and adaptation skills that treated in the tutorial and that are important for 
the user to develop are:</p>
<p>1. Understanding the parts of Adapt It's main window 
(menus, toolbar, modebar, layout of strips, piles).<br>2. 
Positioning the phrase box, typing text into it, pressing Enter to advance 
it.<br>3. Merging source words to make a source phrase.<br>4. Unmerging a source phrase.<br>5. 
Accepting a default adaptation without changes.<br>6. 
Retranslating a section of source text; removing or editing a retranslation.<br>7. Inserting an extra word or phrase; removing inserted 
words or phrases.<br>8. Reading your translation without 
the source text being shown.<br>9. Single-step mode versus 
Automatic mode.<br>10. When there are multiple translations 
- the Choose Translation dialog.<br>11. Leaving a source 
word untranslated - three kinds of "nothing".</p>
<p>There is also a more comprehensive "Adapt It 
Reference.doc" document which you may find helpful.</p>
<p>* <strong>Getting texts by "Chapter 
Only"</strong> is the default method of exchanging texts with Paratext or 
Bibledit. However a user may also select "Get Whole Book"&nbsp;-&nbsp;as is 
shown in the main user dialog during collaboration:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" width="500" height="268" > 
</p>
<p>Users can select to "Get Chapter Only" or "Get Whole 
Book". We recommend that users be trained to leave the default set as "Get 
Chapter Only" -- at least as long as they are adapting one of the larger 
books.&nbsp;Single chapter chunks load and save more quickly than whole books 
such as the Gospels and Acts. Since Adapt It organizes everything and 
automatically does all transfers between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit, 
there is no logistical&nbsp;problem for the user to work chapter by chapter. In 
any case, the user should not change between collaborating by Chapter Only and 
Whole Book for a given book. If adapting chapter-by-chapter, the user should 
continue working chapter-by-chapter until the whole book is finished.</p>
<p>* <strong>Reporting Problems and 
Giving Feedback</strong>. Adapt It is provided free of charge under an open 
source license. The developers are quick to respond to email reports of problems 
and requests. They depend on the reports of any problems as well as feedback 
from field users to improve Adapt It. Before reporting problems to the 
developers, please have a look at the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration" >Trouble 
Shooting</a> topic below. If that does not help you resolve the problem, feel 
free to contact the developers either via email or via the "Report a Problem..." 
selection in Adapt It's help menu (see below).</p>
<p>Adapt It version 6 now has an easy to use email 
reporting feature - located on the Adapt It Help menu. Just click on the Help 
menu item labeled "<strong>Report a Problem...</strong>" 
and Adapt It will display the following dialog - with much of the information 
already filled in:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Report_a_problemDlg.gif" width="400" height="396" > 
</p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and a brief description of the steps to reproduce the 
problem, using the text in the edit box as a guide for your comments. If a 
document is open that illustrates the problem, just click on the "Attach the 
document (packed)" button to include a copy of the packed document along with 
the report. If you have access to the Internet, you can click on the "Send Now" 
button to send your report. Adapt It also saves a copy of your report in the 
_LOGS_EMAIL_REPORTS folder located in its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder. The 
usage log is automatically included in the email report (unless you untick the 
check box). It would likely provide information and possible error messages that 
would help us understand the cause of any problem.</p>
<p>There is also a Help menu item called "<strong>Give Feedback...</strong>". The form looks similar to the 
form for reporting a problem, but is provided to make giving feedback easier to 
do via email:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Give_Feedback.gif" width="400" height="396" ></p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and your feedback in the edit box provided. Use the 
text in the box as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: Adapt It sends all such emails to the developers 
using secured SSL encryption directly from the Adapt It program, so email 
communications are done safely. The user's computer does not have to have an 
email client installed to send these reports.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Adapt It Desktop Launchers For Specific Work 
Scenarios (using command-line switches/options)</h2>
<p>This section describes how to set up desktop icons or 
"launchers" and configure them with command-line switches/options that make 
Adapt It run with collaboration ON or OFF, and also that can make Adapt It use 
certain Paratext or Bibledit projects during collaboration. First, we provide a 
description of the command-line options and how they work. Afterwards we provide 
information on how to setup desktop launchers for typical Windows and Linux 
(including Balsa) systems.<br></p>
<h3><a name="command_line_switches"></a>The command-line switches:</h3>
<p><b>-collab_on</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turns on collaboration, assumes everything has been 
previously setup with the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" dialog from 
Administrator menu. This switch basically does the same thing as clicking the 
"Collaboration ON" radio button in the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" 
dialog, but does it from the command-line. An example command-line usage would 
be:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><tt>adaptit -collab_on</tt></b><br><br>Usually you would use the 
-collab_on switch in combination with the -collab_proj "..." switch (see below). 
<br><br><b>-collab_off&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turns 
off collaboration, so that if collaboration was set ON previously by the 
administrator, this forces Adapt It to run with collaboration OFF. This switch 
basically does the same thing as clicking the "Collaboration OFF" radio button 
in the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" dialog, but does it from the 
command-line.&nbsp; An example command-line usage would be:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><b> adaptit -collab_off</b></tt><br><br>Usually you would use this switch 
in combination with the -ai_proj "..." switch (see below).<br><br><b>-collab_proj "&lt;PT/BE source proj name&gt;:&lt;PT/BE 
target proj name&gt;[:&lt;PT/BE freetrans proj name&gt;]"</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this switch and accompanying string (in double quotes with <strong>: </strong>delimiting at least two fields, optionally three 
fields) tells Adapt It to use a designated PT/BE project name for obtaining 
source texts, a second PT/BE project name for storing target texts, and 
(optionally) a third PT/BE project name for storing free translations. The PT/BE 
project names are separated by colon characters, and the whole project names 
string must be surrounded with double quote characters. Use this switch/option 
together with the -collab_on switch. Examples of command-line usage would be:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>adaptit -collab_on -collab_proj 
"Nyindrou:Tok Pisin"</b></tt><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>adaptit -collab_on -collab_proj "Takia:English:Tok 
Pisin"</b></tt><br><br>in which the 
first example will cause Adapt It to startup in collaboration mode and assign 
the Nyindrou Bibledit project for obtaining its source texts and the Tok Pisin 
Bibledit project for storing its target texts. In the second example, Adapt It 
will start up in collaboration mode and assign the Takia Bibledit project for 
obtaining its source texts, the English Bibledit project for storing its target 
texts, and the Tok Pisin Bibledit project for storing its free translations.<br><br><strong>-ai_proj "&lt;Lang A&gt; to &lt;Lang B&gt; 
adaptations"</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this switch and 
accompanying string (in double quotes) tells Adapt It to pre-select a certain 
Adapt It project when Adapt It runs. Adapt It "projects" are equivalent to the 
names of the project folders inside the "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder. 
Ordinarily this should be used together with the -collab_off switch. In this 
case Adapt It will start up with collaboration OFF, and at the Start Working 
wizard, the "&lt;Lang A&gt; to &lt;Lang B&gt; adaptations" project will be 
selected in the "Select a Project" page of the wizard. The user can then click 
the wizard's "Next &gt;" button and select a document from the "Select a 
Document" page of the wizard. That application with these command-line switches 
in use make Adapt It behave just like it does if the administrator had turned 
collaboration OFF via the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" dialog from 
the Administrator menu. An example of command-line usage would be:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><b> adaptit -collab_off -ai_proj 
"Nyindrou to Tok Pisin adaptations"</b></tt><br><br>which cause Adapt It to startup with collaboration OFF and 
pre-select the "Nyindrou to Tok Pisin adaptations" project in the list of 
projects on the opening page of the Start Working wizard.<br><br><strong>-frm</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <b>-frm</b> switch can be used in combination with any of the 
above switches to make Adapt It operate only in reviewing mode. Hence, you could 
have several different Adapt It launcher icons, each configured to start up with 
collaboration ON or OFF as well as indicate what Paratext or Bibledit projects 
to utilize when collaboration is ON, and what AI projects to use when 
collaboration is OFF. Any such launcher icon can also use the -frm switch to 
force that work scenario to use reviewing mode only.<br><br>It is possible but probably not very likely that an 
administrator might want a session of Adapt It to start up with collaboration ON 
(-collab_on), to work in collaboration with say "Nyindrou" as the BE source 
project, and "Babon" (a dialect of Nyindrou) as the BE target project, and "Tok 
Pisin" as the BE free translation project (-collab_proj "Nyindrou:Babon:Tok 
Pisin")&nbsp; and have the collaboration being done with Adapt It hooked up to 
an existing AI project called "Nyindrou1 to Nyindrou2 adaptations" - because 
that "Nyindrou1 to Nyindrou2 adaptations" project may have been in use 
previously under that project name in the Adapt It Unicode Work folder. In such 
cases it is possible (but not well tested at this point) to launch Adapt It with 
the following command-line:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>adaptit -collab_on -collab_proj "Nyindrou:Babon:Tok Pisin" 
-ai_proj "Nyindrou1 to Nyindrou2 adaptations"<br></b></tt><br><strong>REMINDER</strong>: To effectively use the above 
command-line switches/options, you need to have already set up the projects in 
Paratext or Bibledit that are used in conjunction with the -collab_on switch and 
the string following the -collab_proj option that names the Paratext or Bibledit 
projects to be used.<br><br>Note that, 
when the above command-line switches are used, it&nbsp;won't affect the settings 
that the Adapt It application would use when no command-line switches are used. 
In other words, if the administrator has configured Adapt It to normally run 
with collaboration ON and for a given set of Paratext/Bibledit projects defined 
in the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" dialog, it should continue to 
operate according to that setup whenever switches/options are <strong>not</strong> used at the command-line. For example, if an 
Adapt It launcher icon is setup that does NOT include any of the above 
command-line switches/options, it will always run according to however the 
administrator set things up from the Administrator menu's "Setup Bibledit 
Collaboration" menu item and associated dialog. The use of the above 
command-line switches simply force the application launched with those 
switches/options to behave <b>during that AI session 
only</b>&nbsp;with values forced to abide with what the switches options 
dictate. AI's internal settings in such cases work in those modes, but the 
collaboration-related settings in the basic config file 
(AI-BasicConfiguration.aic) are not affected (not changed) by the presence of 
one of the above switches/options. The advantage of using launchers with the 
command-line switches set by the administrator, is that once set up, the user 
doesn't have to worry about setting collaboration ON or OFF for the launch, nor 
even for which Paratext/Bibledit projects are being used for that launch. And it 
stays that way - until the administrator or person with an understanding of how 
to create and set the command-line in launcher icons decides to change them.</p>
<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in Windows</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Install Adapt It version 
6.2.0 or newer</strong>. Older versions of Adapt It won't support the 
collaboration oriented&nbsp;command-line switches/options described above.<br>2. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the Adapt It 
installation folder, and click on the Adapt It program executable 
file,&nbsp;normally located&nbsp;at <strong>c:\Program 
Files\Adapt It WX Unicode\Adapt_It_Unicode.exe</strong> for the Unicode version, 
or <strong>c:\Program Files\Adapt It 
WX\Adapt_It.exe</strong> for the Regular (ANSI) version.<br>3. Right-click on the Adapt_It_Unicode.exe (or 
Adapt_It.exe) file and select "<strong>Send To</strong>" 
&gt; "<strong>Desktop (create shortcut)</strong>".<br>4. Close or minimize&nbsp;Windows Explorer and any other 
programs so you can see the shortcut that was created in the previous step. 
<strong>Right-click</strong> on that shortcut and select 
"<strong>Rename</strong>". Then enter a brief name for this 
launcher, possibly something like "Adapt It PT work Lang A to Lang B". The 
launcher name should be short but&nbsp;worded so that the user(s) can 
distinguish this launcher from any others you plan to create for other work 
scenarios.<br>5. In this launcher we want to start Adapt It 
with collaboration ON, and using the Paratext project "Lang A" for obtaining 
source texts, and using the Paratext project "Lang B" for storing the adapted 
target texts. For this work scenario we will add these command-line 
switches/options to the launcher icon's properties: <strong><font face="Courier">-collab_on 
-collab_proj "Lang A:LangB"</font></strong> (see next step).<br>6. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the 
desktop shortcut and select "<strong>Properties</strong> ". 
You should see a Shortcut properties dialog that looks something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Windows_shortcut_properties.gif" width="300" height="424" > </p>
<p>We will add the command-line switches/options to the end 
of the existing text that is in the "<strong>Target</strong>" edit box. Press the right arrow key or 
click in the box to remove the highlight, but keep the existing text there in 
the edit box.<br>7. At the end of the existing text path 
<strong>after the last quote mark</strong>, <strong>add a space</strong> and then <strong>type these command-line options</strong>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<font face="Courier"><strong>-collab_on -collab_proj "Lang 
A:Lang B"<br></strong></font><font face="Times New Roman">in which Lang A is the Paratext project to be used for 
obtaining source texts, and Lang B is the Paratext project to be used for 
storing adapted target texts. Note that a colon <strong>:</strong>&nbsp;must be&nbsp;used to separate the two 
Paratext project names. If you want to use a third Paratext project for storing 
Free Translations, it can be included within the double quote marks after a 
second colon like this: <font face="Courier"><strong>"Lang A:Lang B:Lang C"</strong></font>.<br>8. Click on OK to save and close the Shortcut Properties 
dialog. Your desktop launcher is now ready to use. <br><strong>IMPORTANT: Before testing your 
desktop launcher, or having your user(s) make use of it, make sure that ALL 
Paratext projects that Adapt It will collaborate with are completely setup 
according to the <a href="#Automatically" >Automatically exchange Scripture files with 
Paratext or Bibledit</a> section of this document</strong>.<br>9.&nbsp;Double-click the newly created 
desktop&nbsp;shortcut icon&nbsp;labeled "Adapt It PT work Lang A to Lang B" to 
launch Adapt It. Adapt It will start running and automatically switch 
collaboration mode ON, and use the Paratext projects you specified in the quoted 
string following the -collab_proj command-line switch/option.<br>10. To create other launchers for different Adapt It work 
scenarios, follow steps 2 through 9 above, adjusting the name of the desktop 
launcher in step 4, and the command-line switches/options in step 7 according to 
the work scenario you want the launcher to run. See the subheading "<a href="#command_line_switches" >Command-line switches</a>" above&nbsp;for 
other examples of other work scenarios and the command-line switches that can be 
used to&nbsp;affect those work scenarios.</font> </p>
<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in Linux (Ubuntu)</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Install Adapt It version 
6.2.0 or newer for your Linux distribution</strong>. Older versions of Adapt It 
won't support the collaboration oriented command-line switches/options described 
above.<br>2. If you are using the classic Gnome interface, 
click on <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Office</strong>, and <strong>right-click</strong> on the <strong>Adapt It</strong> menu item, and select "<strong>Add this launcher to desktop</strong>".<br>3. If you are using the newer Gnome Unity interface, click 
on the Ubuntu Dashhome icon to open the panel, and type "adaptit" into the 
search bar at the top. When the Adapt It icon appears click on it and drag it to 
an empty area of your desktop.<br>4. Close or minimize any 
other programs so you can see the desktop shortcut that was created in the 
previous step. <strong>Right-click</strong> on that 
shortcut and select "<strong>Rename...</strong>". Then 
enter a brief name for this launcher, possibly something like "Adapt It&nbsp;BE 
work Lang A to Lang B". The launcher name should be short but worded so that the 
user(s) can distinguish this launcher from any others you plan to create for 
other work scenarios.<br>5. In this launcher we want to 
start Adapt It with collaboration ON, and using the Bibledit project "Lang A"

-collab_proj "Lang A:LangB"</font></strong> (see next step).<br>6. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the 
desktop shortcut and select "<strong>Properties</strong> ". 
You should see an Adapt It Properties dialog that looks something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Linux_shortcut_properties.gif" width="500" height="435" > </p>
<p>We will add the command-line switches/options to the end 
of the existing text that is in the "<strong>Command</strong>" edit box. Click in the Command edit 
box.<br>7. After the existing word adaptit&nbsp;<strong>add a space</strong> and then <strong>type these command-line options</strong>:<br><font face="Courier"><strong>-collab_on -collab_proj "Lang A:Lang B"<br></strong></font><font face="Times New Roman">in which Lang A is the Bibledit project to be used for 
obtaining source texts, and Lang B is the Bibledit project to be used for

<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in&nbsp;Balsa (Lucid)</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Log on to the Advisor 
Balsa account and install Adapt It version 6.2.0 or newer for your&nbsp;Lucid 
distribution</strong>. Older versions of Adapt It won't support the 
collaboration oriented command-line switches/options described above.<br>2. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the 
desktop and choose "<strong>Create Launcher...</strong>". 
The Balsa system displays the "Create Launcher" dialog which looks like this:<br><br></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Balsa_create_launcher.gif" width="400" height="361" ></p>
<p><br><br>3. In 
the "Name:" edit box,&nbsp;enter a brief name for this launcher, possibly 
something like "Adapt It BE work Lang A to Lang B". The launcher name should be 
short but worded so that the user(s) can distinguish this launcher from any 
others you plan to create for other work scenarios.<br>4. 
The "Command:" edit box is where&nbsp;we construct the&nbsp;command-line to 
launch Adapt It along with its command-line switches/options. Click on the 
folder icon at the right end of the "Command:" edit box. A "Select an 
Application" dialog comes up that lists the available applications. Scroll down 
a little&nbsp;to the <strong>adaptit</strong> item, select 
it, and click the "Open" button. The system enters <strong>/usr/bin/adaptit</strong> into the "Command:" edit box.<br>5.&nbsp;In this launcher we want to start Adapt It with 
collaboration ON, and using the Bibledit project "Lang A" for obtaining source 
texts, and using the Bibledit project "Lang B" for storing the adapted target 
texts. For this work scenario we will add these command-line switches/options to 
the launcher icon's properties: <strong><font face="Courier">-collab_on -collab_proj "Lang A:LangB"</font></strong> (see 
next step).<br>6. After the <strong>/usr/bin/adaptit</strong> text in the "Command:" edit box 
<strong>add a space</strong> and then <strong>type these command-line options</strong>:<br><font face="Courier"><strong>-collab_on -collab_proj "Lang A:Lang B"<br></strong></font><font face="Times New Roman">in which Lang A is the Bibledit project to be used for 
obtaining source texts, and Lang B is the Bibledit project to be used for 
storing adapted target texts. Note that a colon <strong>:</strong> must be used to separate the two Bibledit 
project names. If you want to use a third Bibledit project (Lang C) for storing 
Free Translations, it can be included within the double quote marks after a 
second colon like this: <font face="Courier"><strong>"Lang A:Lang B:Lang C"</strong></font>.<br>7. Click on the "No icon" button, and select the Adapt It 
icon from the list of application icons, and click OK. The Adapt It icon appears 
in place of the button. You can also enter a comment into the "Comment:" edit 
box if you want to. It will appear as a tool tip when the mouse hovers over the 
launcher.<br>8. Tick the"Use startup notification" check 
box.</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>9. Click on the Create button to create the launcher. Your 
desktop launcher&nbsp;has now been created and is located on the Advisor's 
Desktop. But there is more work to do to install this launcher on the Balsa 
User's desktop along with the default launchers already located there.<br>10. If you can see the newly created launcher on the 
Advisor's desktop go to the next step. If you cannot see the newly created 
launcher on the Advisor's Desktop, you may need to temporarily reduce the size 
of your desktop icons. Right-click on the Desktop and select "Desktop 
Settings..." and click on the "Icon" tab in the Desktop dialog. Under 
"Appearance" reduce the icon size value there to 64 or smaller, and click the 
"Close" button. Now you should be able to see the launcher you created on the 
Advisor's Desktop.<br>11. Right-click on the desktop 
launcher you created, and select <strong>Open with 
"gedit"</strong>. Change the Categories= line so that it reads: <strong>Categories=GTK;Office;</strong> making sure that the two 
words following the = sign end with a semi-colon character <strong>;<br></strong>12. Click on the <strong>File &gt; Save</strong> and then <strong>File &gt; Close</strong> to exit from the gedit editor.<br>13. <strong>Log out of the Advisor 
account and log on to the Balsa User account.<br></strong></font><font face="Times New Roman">14. In the Balsa User account click on the Documents icon 
to start up the File Manager. <br>15. Navigate into the 
File System and find the <strong>/home/advisor/Desktop</strong> folder. In that folder you 
should see the desktop launcher you created earlier while logged into the 
Advisor account.<br>16. Click on the desktop launcher to 
select it and do <strong>Edit &gt; Copy</strong>.<br>17. Navigate back to the <strong>/home/balsa/.local/share/applications</strong> folder and 
do <strong>Edit &gt; Paste</strong>.<br>18. <strong>Log out of the&nbsp;Balsa 
User&nbsp;account and log on to the Balsa Advisor account.<br></strong>19. Double-click on the "<strong>Edit Tabbed Desktop</strong>" icon, and select the "<strong>Balsa User</strong>" item in the popup dialog, and click 
OK. Enter the Advisor password <strong>admin123456</strong> 
and OK. This action starts up the "<strong>Main 
Menu</strong>" editor.<br>20. In the Main Menu editor 
navigate to the <strong>Applications &gt; All Apps &gt; 
Office folder</strong>. You should see there the launcher that you pasted there 
in step 17 above.<br>21. Click on the name of the launcher 
to select it (make sure the check box has a tick in the box).<br>22. Scroll the left hand list up so you can see the "Work" 
menu under Applications. Now back in the Items: list <strong>drag the selected launcher</strong> across to the "Work" 
menu <strong>dropping it directly onto the "Work" menu 
item</strong>. You should ensure that the background of the "Work" shows a 
dotted box before you drop the&nbsp;launcher on that item. Select the "Work" 
item to ensure that your launcher is now in that menu list (you may need to 
scroll down to see it). If it is not there, try the drag and drop action again 
until you see&nbsp;your launcher appear in the list of items under 
the&nbsp;"Work" menu. Note: The ordering of items in the "Work" menu list is the 
order the launchers will appear in the User's Desktop. On small computer 
screens, not all of the launchers listed there may be seen when viewing the 
User's Desktop. If that is the case you can return to the Main Menu editor and 
adjust the order of the icons so that those the need to be seen are up higher in 
the list.<br>23. You can now&nbsp;<strong>Log out of the Advisor account and log on to the Balsa User 
account</strong>. You should now see your launcher on the Balsa User's Desktop. 
<br><strong>IMPORTANT: Before testing 
your desktop launcher, or having your user(s) make use of it, make sure that ALL 
Bibledit projects that Adapt It will collaborate with are completely setup 
according to the <a href="#Automatically" >Automatically exchange Scripture files with 
Paratext or Bibledit</a> section of this document</strong>.<br>24. Double-click the newly created desktop shortcut icon 
labeled "Adapt It PT work Lang A to Lang B" to launch Adapt It. Adapt It will 
start running and automatically switch collaboration mode ON, and use the 
Bibledit projects you specified in the quoted string following the -collab_proj 
command-line switch/option.<br>25. To create other 
launchers for different Adapt It work scenarios, follow the above steps for each 
new launcher you create, adjusting the&nbsp;specific properties&nbsp;of the 
desktop launcher&nbsp;using steps 3-12 according to the work scenario you want 
the launcher to force Adapt It to use when it runs. See the subheading "<a href="#command_line_switches" >Command-line switches</a>" above for 
other examples of other work scenarios and the command-line switches that can be 
used to affect those work scenarios.</font> </p>

<h2><a name="trouble_shooting_collaboration"></a>Trouble Shooting</h2>
<h3>Problems in Collaboration with Paratext</h3>
<p>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it 
uses to exchange data between Adapt It and Paratext. Adapt It installs a utility 
program called <strong>rdwrtp7.exe</strong> that it 
attempts to execute when collaborating with Paratext on Windows systems. 
Ordinarily you need not worry about these utility programs. However, we have not 
been able to test these utility programs on all possible computer system 
configurations and architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Paratext, it is likely that the problem could 
be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to account for between your 
computer system and the version of the utility program installed by Adapt 
It.</p>
<p>When the Paratext development team releases a new 
version of Paratext, and you have upgraded to the newer version, you should 
insure that Adapt It can still collaborate with the newer&nbsp;version of 
Paratext. If you encounter a problem with Adapt It - Paratext collaboration 
after updating your Paratext installation, please let us know so we can provide 
an Adapt It update that will correct the problem. Such problems are not very 
likely to happen between Adapt It and Paratext, but if they do happen it is most 
likely they would happen after a fairly major update of either Paratext or Adapt 
It. Please write down the text of any error messages that appear, and include 
those with any reports problem reports you send us. If you have Internet access 
you can try submitting a report directly from Adapt It (see the "Report a 
Problem..." selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a report via 
regular email (our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About Adapt It..." 
selection on the Help menu.</p>
<h3>Problems in Collaboration with Bibledit</h3>
<p>Note: Most problems in collaboration between Adapt It 
and Bibledit can be solved by ensuring that your version of Adapt It is at least 
version 6.1.0 and your version of Bibledit is at least 4.3. See the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Step 1 of the Bibledit setup process</a>. 
If you have done all the setup steps for Bibledit, but are still having 
problems, the information below may be of some help.</p>
<p>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it 
uses to exchange data between Adapt It and Bibledit. There are different utility 
programs for different computer architectures (32-bit, 64-bit, etc.) and Ubuntu 
distributions. Adapt It installs a utility program called <strong>adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong> for collaboration with 
Bibledit on Linux systems. Ordinarily you need not worry about these utility 
programs. However, we have not been able to test these utility programs on all 
possible computer system configurations, and especially on different Linux 
distributions/architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit, it is likely that the problem could 
be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to account for between your 
computer system and the version of the utility program installed by Adapt 
It.</p>
<p>The Bibledit development team has provided an official 
collaboration utility (called bibledit-rdwrt) that became available in Bibledit 
version 4.2.93 or newer. Until a bibledit-gtk version of Bibledit becomes 
readily available in the Ubuntu distributions that is <strong>at least version 4.2.93</strong> or later (which comes with 
its own bibledit-rdwrt utility),&nbsp;users may encounter&nbsp;situations where 
Adapt It's version of the utility (called adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt to distinguish 
it from the one to be supplied by future version of Bibledit) is not compatible 
with the&nbsp;user's system configuration - i.e., needs a version of a Linux 
dynamic library that is not&nbsp;available or is incorrect, for 
example.&nbsp;If&nbsp;an error in Adapt It for Linux appears like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/CollabErrorLinux2.gif" width="455" height="231" > 
</p>
<p>it means that Adapt It has located the 
adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility but it cannot execute the&nbsp;utility program. 
This error indicates that the permissions are not correctly assigned to the 
utility program at the location indicated in the error message.&nbsp;You should 
be able to resolve this issue by changing the utility program's permissions by 
typing the following command from within a Linux terminal session:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>sudo chmod a+x 
/usr/local/bin/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong></font> </p>
<p>and that should correct the error.</p>
<p>If an error in Adapt It for Linux appears like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/CollabErrorLinux1.gif" width="474" height="248" > 
</p>
<p>It means that there is a library mismatch problem in 
the&nbsp;version of Adapt It's adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility&nbsp;that it 
installed on the user's system. On the Adapt It website we have posted versions 
of the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility program for i386 (32-bit) and amd64 
(64-bit) architectures for the Lucid, Maverick, Natty, and Oneiric Ubuntu 
distributions. If you have Internet access, you&nbsp;should also be able to 
resolve this issue, by downloading a version of adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt that is 
appropriate for your computer system and ensuring that it is located in the 
correct system directory and has executable permissions. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. First, ensure that you have upgraded your version of 
Adapt It to at least version 6.1.0 from the packages.sil.org/ubuntu repository. 
Look at the "About Adapt It..." selection on the Help menu to verify your 
installed version of Adapt It is at least 6.1.0.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Click on one of the following links, or enter the 
appropriate&nbsp;URL into the address bar of your browser&nbsp;(depending on 
your architecture and Ubuntu distribution):</p>

<p>Your browser should then download the 
adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility file. Note the location where your browser 
downloads the file. <br>Note: If you are 
using&nbsp;Balsa&nbsp;the download of the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility will 
probably go into the Downloads folder on advisor@Balsa. That copy of the 
adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility is built specifically for Ubuntu Lucid i386, so 
it should work on your Lucid based Balsa installation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Verify&nbsp;where Adapt It&nbsp;is installed on 
your system. It would normally be installed to either the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/bin/</strong> directory or the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong> directory:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>ls -l 
/usr/bin/adaptit*</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font 
face=Courier><strong>ls -l 
/usr/local/bin/adaptit*<br></strong></font><br>Note the location of the adaptit it executable file for the 
copy destination in the next step. In most cases that location would be <strong>/usr/bin/</strong> .</p>
<p>4. Start a Terminal session and, as super user from the 
command-line,&nbsp;copy the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt file to the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/bin</strong> directory (or <strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong> if the above step locates it 
there):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>sudo cp 
Downloads/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt /usr/bin<br></strong></font><br>5. Check the

in the step above:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>ls -l 
/usr/bin/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong></font><br><br>6. If it does not have executable permissions (-rwxr-xr-x) 
on the file, invoke chmod to make&nbsp;the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt 
file&nbsp;executable:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font 
face=Courier><strong> sudo chmod a+x

successfully collaborate with Bibledit. Detailed instructions for that setup are 
found in the Help_for_Administrators.htm file located in the installation at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>/usr/share/adaptit/help/Help_for_Administrators.htm</strong></font><br><br>That Help_for_Administrators.html 
file&nbsp;can also be loaded into the default browser while running Adapt It by 
selecting the <strong>Help for Administrators 
(HTML)</strong> menu item from Adapt It's <strong>Administrator</strong> menu.<br><br>If you still find that collaboration with Bibledit is 
failing after trying the above, please inform&nbsp;the Adapt It developers about 
the problem, so we can find a solution and possibly make a corrected version 
available in a future&nbsp;update at packages.sil.org. If you continue 
to&nbsp;get&nbsp;one or more of the above&nbsp;errors or some other error during 
collaboration, please write down the text of any error messages that appear, and 
include that information&nbsp;with any reports problem reports you send us. If 
you have Internet acces you can try submitting a report directly from Adapt It 
(see the "Report a Problem..." selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us 
a report via regular email (our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About 
Adapt It..." selection on the Help menu. Please include&nbsp;what distribution 
of Ubuntu you&nbsp;are running&nbsp;and whether it is a 32-bit (i386) or 64-bit 
(amd64) system, plus any other details you think might help us to provide a 
fix.&nbsp;Detailed information about your system&nbsp;should be 
available&nbsp;by accessing&nbsp;your System Info (via System &gt;Administration
