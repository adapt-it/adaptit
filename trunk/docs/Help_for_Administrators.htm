<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is normally hidden from view. It can 
only be shown and accessed under password control. To make the Administrator 
menu visible you can select the <strong>Show Administrator Menu</strong> menu 
item from the View menu. To initially show the Administrator menu you will need 
to use the <a href="#default_password">default password</a>. Once you have 
access to the Administrator menu&nbsp;you can assign a personalized password for 
accessing the Administrator menu, however, the <a 
href="#default_password">default password</a> will always work to make the 
Administrator menu visible at any time.</p>
<p>                  
             
     The Adapt It team highly recommends that you 
take advantage of the Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful 
setup can make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and 
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> .</p>

<h2><a name="adaptit_projects_vs_pt_or_be_projects"></a>Adapt It Projects versus 
Paratext or Bibledit Projects</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Some of the discussion about 
establishing connections between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit projects may 
be confusing if you are not aware of the different approaches these translation 
applications have to translation projects. Both Paratext and Bibledit 
consider&nbsp;a project to involve the creation of a translation in only 
<strong>one</strong> language. These applications may bring in translation 
resources such as Bible translations in other languages to assist the human 
translator. Each translation resource is&nbsp;stored in a&nbsp;single Paratext 
or Bibledit project.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span 
style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Since Adapt It partially automates 
the translation process it involves the use of <b 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">two</i></b> languages in its 
projects:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">A source language text which has been prepared before the 
start of the project.</p>
  <li>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A target language test which is 
  developed as the output of the adaptation process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Because Adapt It works with a minimum of two languages, 
collaboration requires the development of at least <strong>two</strong> projects in Paratext or Bibledit for each Adapt 
It project:</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span

style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span></span><span style="COLOR: black">A 
target project that is initially empty so that it can receive the target 
language text produced by Adapt It.</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">In addition, since Adapt It has the ability to create free 
translations, you may&nbsp;want to create another empty Paratext or Bibledit 
project to receive the free translations. </span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="COLOR: black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Collaboration between Adapt It and either Paratext or 
Bibledit means that the strengths of both translation applications are available 
to the translator in a relatively seamless process. When collaborating with 
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It creates and maintains its own projects in project 
folders - just as it did in previous versions of Adapt It. But when 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It&nbsp;automatically handles the 
transfer of&nbsp;source texts from Paratext or Bibledit to its&nbsp;Adapt It's 
own&nbsp;project and automatically handles the transfer of adapted/target texts 
(and free translations) back to the appropriate Paratext or Bibledit projects, 
where they can be revised, checked and polished in Paratext or 
Bibledit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: black">One other difference between Adapt It and&nbsp;the other 
programs&nbsp;is that Adapt It is stores documents at the chapter or book 
level.&nbsp;Paratext stores documents at the book level only. Bibledit stores 
documents at the chapter level only. The collaboration process knows about this 
difference and is able to accommodate it. However, it does have implication for 
the planning process by the administrator. You need to plan ahead in determining 
what books are to be translated</span> and the approach you want to use. The AI 
team recommends that you use a chapter by chapter approach consistently. 
Therefore working in collaboration uses the chapter by chapter approach by 
default. This means that, although Adapt It uses&nbsp;smaller 
units&nbsp;in&nbsp;its own&nbsp;AI project, collaboration mode keeps the 
Paratext texts in book units, and the Bibledit texts in their chapter units.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus any organization method is 
supported. However, once you decide to use a book or a chapter as an adaptation 
unit you should keep using that unit throughout the the work in a project. For a 
given book, you should not do adaptation work part of the time using the whole 
book approach&nbsp;and part of the time using a chapter by chapter 
approach.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Automatically"></a>Automatically exchange Scripture files with Paratext or 
Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start" >Paratext</a> or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Bibledit</a> . Here are the steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>
<h3>1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It 
(6.2.1) and Paratext (7.1 or newer) are installed</h3></h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For 
Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext, you need to <strong>install version 7.1 or newer of Paratext and version 6.2.1 
or newer of Adapt It</strong> . The most recent Windows version of Adapt 
It&nbsp;is&nbsp;available at&nbsp;<a href="http://adapt-it.org.">http://adapt-it.org.</a> If your version of Adapt It is not 
at least 6.2.1 or newer, you will need to download and install it. If you used 
Adapt It version 6.0.x or 6.1.x previously, please note that as of version 
6.2.1, collaboration with Paratext can now be setup for individual Adapt It 
projects, and it is now the user's decision as to whether to turn collaboration 
on or off for a given Adapt It project. Therefore, if you have previously used 
version 6.0.x or 6.1.x of Adapt It for collaboration with Paratext, your 
collaboration settings will be preserved in upgrading to 6.2.1, but please 
review the&nbsp;section below carefully for differences in how collaboration is 
now setup and used.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up 
Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext, you should ensure that Paratext has at 
least <strong>TWO</strong> projects set up -- one project 
for obtaining <strong>source</strong> texts, and a 
different project to receive the <strong>translation 
drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. (You may also want to have a third project 
set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>.) The <strong>source</strong> project 
needs to have completed texts, either imported from a source or completed in 
Paratext. You need to include <em>all 
</em>texts&nbsp;that&nbsp;are to be translated in the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project(s) that are to receive the translation draft 
(and free translation, if desired) need to be established as well. These 
projects need to contain "<strong>empty</strong> " books 
which include the chapter and verse USFM markers. There needs to be an empty 
book to correspond to each of the books in the source project. The USFM markers 
are necessary for&nbsp;Adapt It to properly place the draft translations.</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 419px; HEIGHT: 415px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=419 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/PTNewProject.gif" width="400" height="381" ></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and 
      Settings"&nbsp; dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p><br>As you create the projects it 
is important to ensure that the <strong>Language</strong> 
field is set correctly in Paratext's <strong>Project 
Properties and Settings</strong> dialog&nbsp;for each Paratext project in 
the&nbsp;Adapt It&nbsp;collaboration. Press the <strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New...</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a unique&nbsp;language 
name for each project.&nbsp;Paratext provides you with a small set of defined 
languages and if&nbsp;one of your languages is not in the defined list, you can 
establish a new one by pressing the <strong>New...</strong> 
button. Therefore, if the&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;project&nbsp;has the objective 
of translating&nbsp;<strong>Swahili</strong> texts to 
<strong>English</strong>,&nbsp;the "source" project's 
<strong>Language</strong> field should be set to <strong>Swahili</strong>. In the same way, the&nbsp;"target texts" 
project's <strong>Language</strong> field should be set to 
<strong>English</strong>.<strong> 
</strong>You may need to establish Swahili as a "new" language; however, English 
is a&nbsp; Paratext predefined language. Free translation projects&nbsp;may be 
in the same language as the target project or in a different language for 
reading by a consultant.</p>
<h3>3. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p>The next step is to set up the collaboration in Adapt 
It. This process takes place using the <strong>Administrator</strong> menu.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width="300" height="240" > </p>
<p align="left">When you select "Setup Collaboration..." the 
following dialog appears:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 407px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=389 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/SetupPTCollabNoLangNamesCtrls.gif" width="550" height="391" ></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up Collaboration" 
    dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p><br>You should follow the 4 
numbered steps as shown on this dialog:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <div>Select an existing Adapt It project from the 
  drop-down list that you want to use for collaboration. If the Adapt It project 
  does not yet exist you can click on the "Create New Adapt It Project" button 
  to create an empty Adapt It project for Adapt It to use in the collaboration 
  process. An Adapt It&nbsp;project is&nbsp;needed to keep its adaptation 
  documents during collaboration. If&nbsp;you select an Adapt It project that 
  has previously been configured for collaboration,&nbsp;its collaboration 
  settings will appear in the data fields&nbsp;in Step 3.<br 
  ><br></div>
  <li>
  <div>The choices for Scripture Editor will depend on 
  which programs are installed on your computer, and whether you previously had 
  collaboration working on your computer. If your computer has both Paratext and 
  Bibledit installed both the "Paratext" and "Bibledit" choices will be 
  available, but usually only one choice will be available. <strong 
  >Verify that the Paratext or Bibledit projects have 
  already been created within Paratext</strong> <strong>or 
  Bibledit</strong>. A minimum of <strong>at least two 
  projects</strong> are required: One project for obtaining source texts for 
  adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different project to receive the adapted 
  texts produced by Adapt It. If the user wants to create a "free translation" 
  in addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third project set up to 
  receive free translations.</div>
  <p dir="ltr">The Paratext/Bibledit projects need to have 
  ALL of the books that are to be adapted in the overall project.&nbsp;This 
  means that&nbsp;you need to import&nbsp;all available&nbsp;source text 
  books&nbsp;into the Paratext/Bibledit&nbsp;source text project. In the project 
  that is to receive adapted texts, you should <strong 
  >create</strong> the same set of books as in the source 
  project. When creating books in the projects for receiving translated drafts 
  or free translations, they should be created <strong 
  >empty</strong>, but&nbsp;<strong 
  >with chapter and verse numbers</strong> (the 
default).</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">Each line in the 
  list displays a single Paratext or Bibledit&nbsp;project.&nbsp;For Paratext, 
  the list lines have up to four parts separated by colon characters (:). The 
  first part is the Paratext "Short Name". The second part is the Paratext "Full 
  Name" for that project. The third part is the "Language" name. The fourth 
  part&nbsp;(if it has been defined within Paratext) is the language code for 
  that project. Bibledit projects have a single part which is generally the same 
  name as the Bibledit project.&nbsp;Important: If you do not see the expected 
  projects, you should STOP at this point in the Adapt It setup.&nbsp;Close 
  the&nbsp;Setup Collaboration dialog (without saving any changes),&nbsp;and go 
  back to Paratext or Bibledit to do the necessary setup. You will not be able 
  to complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary Paratext 
  or Bibledit &nbsp;projects&nbsp;exist.</p>
  <li>
  <p>
  <div>Once you have ensured that the necessary projects 
  have been created, you need to <strong>select at least 
  two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong> shown in 
  step 3. Click on the first "Select from List" button and select the project 
  from which source texts will be obtained during collaboration. Then click on 
  the second "Select from List" button and select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;project 
  which is to receive translation drafts during collaboration. If you have set 
  up a third project to receive free translations, use the third button to 
  select that project. The projects selected will appear in the dialog to the 
  left of the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project 
  for receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using 
  the "No Free Translation" button. <br><br></div>
  <li>
  <div>Click on the "Accept this setup and prepare for 
  another" button to save this collaboration scenario in the Adapt It' project 
  configuration file. Adapt It will verify that the setup configuration has been 
  saved. The data fields of the dialog now become empty in case you want to set 
  up another collaboration projects while working in this dialog. If you have 
  selected an Adapt It project in Step 1 that has previously been configured for 
  collaboration its settings will appear in the data fields of Step 3. If for 
  some reason you want to remove the collaboration settings for the selected 
  Adapt It project, you can do so by clicking the "Remove this AI Project from 
  Collaboration" button.</div></li></ol>
<p>When have finished configuring collaboration setups, 
click on the Close button to close the "Setup Collaboration" dialog. The Start 
Working Wizard will appear. You&nbsp;can now test how the application will work 
for the user. From the wizard's "Select a Project" page, select a project that 
you have just configured for collaboration.</p>
<p>You will then see what the user&nbsp;sees when opening 
that project - a dialog that looks like this:<br><br></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ChooseCollabOptionsDlg.gif" width="350" height="157" ></p>
<p><br>The user has three&nbsp;options 
for entering a project that you have configured for collaboration. The three 
options correspond to the three radio buttons in the above dialog. The first two 
buttons are designed to allow the user to decide whether he wants to work 
on&nbsp;texts in that project with collaboration on or off. When he elects to 
"Work with my Paratext Scripture texts (Collaboration&nbsp;on)" and 
clicks&nbsp;the OK button, the wizard will close and he will see the main 
book/chapter selection&nbsp;dialog (see below). If&nbsp;he elects to "Work with 
other Adapt It texts (Paratext texts not available: Collaboration off)" the 
wizard will continue on to the "Select a Document" page of the wizard, where he 
can then select any non-collaboration documents that are available&nbsp;for 
adaptation work.&nbsp;With collaboration turned off the user will work 
with&nbsp;Adapt It,&nbsp;adapting non-collaboration texts in the same way that 
Adapt It worked before&nbsp;its collaboration features were added in version 
6.&nbsp;Thus, a single&nbsp;Adapt It project may contain documents that&nbsp;are 
created both when collaboration is on, and when collaboration is turned off. 
When collaboration is turned on, the user never needs to interact with&nbsp;any 
documents - he only chooses scripture books and chapters (see below). When 
collaboration is turned off for the same Adapt It project, the user will 
see&nbsp;and interact with only non-collaboration documents using the "Select a 
Document" page of the wizard.<br><br>The third option for entering a project is designed for 
advisors and consultants&nbsp;to use. It is labeled "Read-only mode (All texts 
accessible but not editable - I'm an advisor or consultant)". When this option 
is selected, collaboration mode remains off and the "Select a Document" page of 
the wizard appears. In this case all documents, both collaboration documents 
(whose names begin with "_Collab...") and non-collaboration documents will 
appear in the list of&nbsp;documents, and any of them can be opened. 
However,&nbsp;with this third option in effect, all documents opened will be in 
read-only mode. This mode is designed so that an advisor or consultant can view 
the user's work without risk of making any unintended changes. When in this 
mode, the background of the main Adapt It window will be pink as a reminder that 
read-only mode is in effect and any changes made in that mode cannot be saved, 
but will be lost when the document is closed.</p>
<p>When the user selects "Work with my Paratext Scripture 
texts (Collaboration on)",&nbsp;after a short pause the following collaboration 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width="500" height="295" > </p>
<p>This is the main dialog that the user will see when 
collaboration is turned on&nbsp;for the given project. From this simple dialog 
the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. The dialog 
shows a list of the scripture books available in Paratext's&nbsp;Source Project. 
It also shows the chapters for the book together with information about the 
status of the target text as it is currently stored in Paratext's Target 
Project. The user can select any Paratext book and chapter to work on.&nbsp;When 
OK is clicked, Adapt It automatically fetches the&nbsp;source text and any 
existing target text from&nbsp;Paratext and displays them in Adapt It's main 
window, ready to continue the adaptation process. When work is saved within 
Adapt It,&nbsp;Adapt It automatically transfers the&nbsp;saved target 
translation back to the appropriate Paratext project. If a Paratext project is 
set up for storing free translations, those are also saved in the appropriate 
Paratext project.</p>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and 
then moving the results to Paratext involved a lot of manual work -- copying and 
joining chapter files together into whole books and copying them back and forth 
between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Adapt It knows how to handle the 
consolidation of books into chapters and how to break books into chapters. All 
the details and organization of files are processed behind the scenes and 
invisible to the user. During collaboration work the user never needs to 
navigate around in the computer's file system and never needs to find or copy or 
move files.</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It works in collaboration with 
Paratext, it not only transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext 
projects -- it also maintains its own collaboration project in the computer's 
"Adapt It Unicode Work" folder (or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode 
version). If the Adapt It project has already been established and work has 
already been done in the two languages, the collaboration project can take 
advantage of the previously developed&nbsp;project knowledge base. The 
collaboration project continues to develop the knowledge base. You should be 
aware however that you can not continue to work on previously created documents 
while Adapt It is in collaboration mode. Collaboration mode must turned off to 
work in standard Adapt It documents.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you

<p>For Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit, you need to 
<strong>install version 6.2.1 or newer of Adapt It and 
version 4.3 or newer of Bibledit-gtk</strong>.&nbsp;The current version of Adapt 
It packaged in the SIL repositories can handle collaboration. Getting a new 
enough version of&nbsp;Bibledit is a little more difficult. The versions 
packaged in the&nbsp;standard Ubuntu repositories (through Onerirc), are not new 
enough&nbsp;to handle collaboration (typically they have version 4.0 or 
older).&nbsp;The SIL <a href="http://packages.sil.org">packages.sil.org</a> repository has a version of Bibledit 
(4.2.67) for Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, Natty and Oneiric but that version still 
does not support collaboration with Adapt It.&nbsp;Until the official Ubuntu 
repositories get a newer version of Bibledit, the Bibledit team has made newer 
versions of Bibledit available in the CrossWire repository. Therefore, in order 
to be able to get Adapt It and Bibledit to collaborate together,&nbsp;you will 
need to ensure that your Software Sources have the necessary repositories listed 
in their "Other Software" settings. Do the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Start 
up&nbsp;<strong>Synaptic Package Manager. </strong>It 
should be located in the System&nbsp;&gt; Administration menu (If it is not 
there or you are using Unity, which doesn't install it by default,&nbsp;you can 
find&nbsp;the Synaptic Package Manager by clicking on "Ubuntu Software 
Center".&nbsp;In the Ubuntu Software Center's Search box type "Synaptic", then 
click on the "Synaptic Package Manager" item when it appears and click on 
"Install").</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> In the Synaptic 
Package Manager application click on the <strong>Settings 
&gt; Repositories</strong>. Click on the "<strong>Other 
Software</strong>" tab. Examine the list of software repositories. If there is 
not already a line that contains a reference to <strong>http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;...</strong>, then 
click on the "Add..." button at the bottom. Then enter <strong>one</strong> of the following lines depending on which 
distribution of Ubuntu Linux is installed on your machine:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu lucid main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu maverick main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;natty main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu oneiric 
main<br>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise main</strong></font> </p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Close the 
Software Sources, and return to the Synaptic Package Manager, <strong>click on "Reload"</strong> to insure you have the latest 
information from the repositories. If you get an error, check that you have 
entered the correct line into your Other Software (step b above).</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Click on the 
"Search" button and type <strong>adaptit</strong> in the 
search box. When the&nbsp;adaptit packages appear, look&nbsp;at the "Installed 
Version" and "Latest Version" columns. Ensure that the version listed for 
adaptit is <strong>at least 6.2.1</strong>. If the "Latest 
Version" (if no version of adaptit is at least 6.2.1 make sure you have set up 
the http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu line correctly in the Synaptic Package 
Manager's Software Sources setup in step b above). If no version is listed in 
the "Installed Version", or if the "Latest Version" is newer than&nbsp;the 
"Installed Version" listed you should mark the adaptit is entries for 
installation or upgrade. To mark the adaptit and adaptit-docs packages, right 
click on them and select "Mark for Installation" or "Mark for Upgrade" from the 
popup menu. Select the "Mark" button in the warning dialog. Then click on the 
"Apply" button at the top of the Synaptic Package Manager application, and click 
on the "Apply" button on the Summary dialog. Close Synaptic Package Manager 
after it completes the installation of Adapt It.</p>


<p><strong>e.</strong> In the Synaptic 
Package Manager application click on the <strong>Settings 
&gt; Repositories</strong>. Click on the "<strong>Other 
Software</strong>" tab. Examine the list of software repositories. If there is 
not already a line that contains a reference to <strong>http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu&nbsp;...</strong>, then 
click on the "Add..." button at the bottom. Then enter <strong>one</strong> of the following lines depending on which 
distribution of Ubuntu Linux is installed on your machine:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu lucid main<br>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu maverick main<br>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu&nbsp;natty main<br>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu oneiric 
main<br>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pkgcrosswire/ppa/ubuntu precise main</strong></font> </p>
<p><strong>f.</strong> Close the 
Software Sources, and return to the Synaptic Package Manager, <strong>click on "Reload"</strong> to insure you have the latest 
information from the repositories. If you get an error, check that you have 
entered the correct line into your Other Software (step e above).</p>
<p><strong>g.</strong> Click on the 
"Search" button and type <strong>bibledit-gtk</strong> in the 
search box. When the&nbsp;bibledit-gtk and bibledit-gtk-data packages appear, look&nbsp;at the "Installed 
Version" and "Latest Version" columns. Ensure that the version listed for 
bibledit is <strong>at least 4.3</strong>. If no version is listed in 
the "Installed Version", or if the "Latest Version" is newer than&nbsp;the 
"Installed Version" listed you should mark the bibledit-gtk and bibledit-gtk-data entries for 
installation or upgrade. To mark the bibledit-gtk and bibledit-gtk-data packages, right 
click on them and select "Mark for Installation" or "Mark for Upgrade" from the 
popup menu. Select the "Mark" button in the warning dialog. Then click on the 
"Apply" button at the top of the Synaptic Package Manager application, and click 
on the "Apply" button on the Summary dialog. Close Synaptic Package Manager 
after it completes the installation of bibledit-gtk.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> if the only version of bibledit-gtk listed is lower than 4.3, take the following steps:<br>
<ul><li> In the Synaptic 
Package Manager application click on the <strong>Settings 
&gt; Repositories</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the '<strong>Other 
Software</strong>' tab.</li>
<li>Uncheck any repository containing <strong>http://packages.sil.org</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat steps f and g above.</ul></p>

<p>After their installation, both Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Bibledit-Gtk should be listed in the Office menu (or can be found by 
searching for adaptit or bibledit on Unity's Desk Home search bar). The next 
step is to ensure that you have your Bibledit projects (at least two) setup 
within Bibledit.</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up 
Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit, you should ensure that Bibledit has at 
least <strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project 
for obtaining <strong>source</strong> texts, and a 
different project to receive the <strong>translation 
drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to have a third project 
set up within Bibledit for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong> . These projects should be set up, complete with books 
either imported or created within Bibledit <strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to collaborate with 
Bibledit. Select File &gt; Project &gt; New to access Bibledit's "Project 
properties" dialog. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 412px; HEIGHT: 352px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=412 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BENewProject.gif" width="400" height="318" ></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Bibledit "Project properties" 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p align="left">Note: You can ignore the Language setting 
field shown above during the setup for collaboration. If you know how to set up 
a customized Bibledit language name you can do so; but because of the difficulty 
for most users, Adapt It does not make use of&nbsp;the "Language" setting here 
in the Bibledit Project's&nbsp;properties dialog. Instead Adapt 
It&nbsp;will&nbsp;allow you to define&nbsp;the language names it will 
use&nbsp;for the Bibledit projects participating in&nbsp;the collaboration 
process (see below).</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long 
term goal in mind when creating the Bibledit projects and the books for those 
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the 
Bibledit project used for source texts ALL books that may eventually be adapted 
using Adapt It. In the Bibledit project that is to receive adapted texts, you 
should <strong>create</strong>&nbsp;ALL the books that may 
ever be translated now at the beginning of the project. When creating books in 
the Bibledit projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but <strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong> (the Bibledit default). To do this, after you add a book, use 
the "+ Templates" button to get the book's chapters setup with USFM markers 
without any text content. </p>
<h3>3. Set Up Adapt It - Bibledit Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupBECollab.gif" width="300" height="240" > </p>
<p align="left">When you select "Setup Collaboration..." the 
following dialog appears:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 390px; HEIGHT: 353px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=390 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/SetUpBibleditCollaboration.gif" width="550" height="357" ></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up&nbsp;Collaboration" 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p><br>You should follow the 4 
numbered steps as shown on this dialog:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <div>Select an existing Adapt It project from the 
  drop-down list that you want to use for collaboration. If the Adapt It project 
  does not yet exist you can click on the "Create New Adapt It Project" button 
  to create an empty Adapt It project for Adapt It to use in the collaboration 
  process. An Adapt It&nbsp;project is&nbsp;needed to keep its adaptation 
  documents during collaboration. If&nbsp;you select an Adapt It project that 
  has previously been configured for collaboration,&nbsp;its collaboration 
  settings will appear in the data fields&nbsp;in Step 3.<br 
  ><br></div>
  <li>
  <div>The choices for Scripture Editor will depend on 
  which programs are installed on your computer, and whether you previously had 
  collaboration working on your computer. If your computer has both Paratext and 
  Bibledit installed both the "Paratext" and "Bibledit" choices will be 
  available, but usually only one choice will be available. 
  <strong></strong><strong>Verify that the Bibledit or 
  Bibledit projects have already been created within Bibledit or 
  Paratext</strong>. A minimum of <strong>at least two 
  projects</strong> are required: One project for obtaining source texts for 
  adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different project to receive the adapted 
  texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free translation in 
  addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third project set up to receive 
  free translations.<br><br>The 
  Paratext/Bibledit projects need to have ALL of the books that are to be 
  adapted in the overall project.&nbsp;This means that&nbsp;you need to 
  import&nbsp;all available&nbsp;source text books&nbsp;into the 
  Paratext/Bibledit source text project. In the project that is to receive 
  adapted texts, you should <strong>create</strong> the 
  same set of books as in the source project. When creating books in the 
  projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they should be 
  created <strong>empty</strong> , but&nbsp;<strong 
  >with chapter and verse numbers</strong> (the default).<br 
  ><br>Each line in the list displays a 
  single Paratext or Bibledit project. For Paratext, the list lines have up to 
  four parts separated by colon characters (:). The first part is the Paratext 
  "Short Name". The second part is the Paratext "Full Name" for that project. 
  The third part is the "Language" name. The fourth part&nbsp;(if it has been 
  defined within Paratext) is the language code for that project. Bibledit 
  projects have a single part which is generally the same name as the Bibledit 
  project.&nbsp;Important: If you do not see the projects listed that your user 
  will need to use in collaboration, you should STOP at this point in the Adapt 
  It setup. Cancel from the Setup Collaboration dialog and do the necessary 
  setup of the Paratext or Bibledit projects first. You will not be able to 
  complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary Paratext or 
  Bibledit projects already exist.<br><br 
  ></div>
  <li>
  <div>Once you have ensured that the necessary projects 
  have been created, you need to <strong>select at least 
  two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong> shown in 
  step 3. Click on the first "Select from List" button and select the project 
  from which source texts will be obtained during collaboration. Then click on 
  the second "Select from List" button and select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;project 
  which is to receive translation drafts during collaboration. If you have set 
  up a third project to receive free translations, use the third button to 
  select that project. The projects selected will appear in the dialog to the 
  left of the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project 
  for receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using 
  the "No Free Translation" button.<br><br 
  ></div>
  <li>
  <div>Click on the "Accept this setup and prepare for 
  another" button to save this collaboration scenario in the Adapt It' project 
  configuration file. Adapt It will verify that the setup configuration has been 
  saved. The data fields of the dialog now become empty in case you want to set 
  up another collaboration projects while working in this dialog. If you have 
  selected an Adapt It project in Step 1 that has previously been configured for 
  collaboration its settings will appear in the data fields of Step 3. If for 
  some reason you want to remove the collaboration settings for the selected 
  Adapt It project, you can do so by clicking the "Remove this AI Project from 
  Collaboration" button.</div></li></ol>
<p>When have finished configuring collaboration setups, 
click on the Close button to close the "Setup&nbsp;Collaboration" dialog. The 
Start Working Wizard will appear. You&nbsp;can now test how the application will 
work for the user. From the wizard's "Select a Project" page, select a project 
that you have just configured for collaboration.</p>
<p>You will then see what the user&nbsp;sees when opening 
that project - a dialog that looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ChooseCollabOptionsDlg_BE.gif" width="400" height="159" ></p>
<p>The user has three&nbsp;options for entering a project 
that you have configured for collaboration. The three options correspond to the 
three radio buttons in the above dialog. The first two buttons are designed to 
allow the user to decide whether he wants to work on&nbsp;texts in that project 
with collaboration on or off. When he elects to "Work with my Bibledit Scripture 
texts (Collaboration&nbsp;on)" and clicks&nbsp;the OK button, the wizard will 
close and he will see the main book/chapter selection&nbsp;dialog (see below). 
If&nbsp;he elects to "Work with other Adapt It texts (Bibledit texts not 
available: Collaboration off)" the wizard will continue on to the "Select a 
Document" page of the wizard, where he can then select any non-collaboration 
documents that are available&nbsp;for adaptation work.&nbsp;With collaboration 
turned off the user will work with&nbsp;Adapt It,&nbsp;adapting 
non-collaboration texts in the same way that Adapt It worked before&nbsp;its 
collaboration features were added in version 6.&nbsp;Thus, a single&nbsp;Adapt 
It project may contain documents that&nbsp;are created both when collaboration 
is on, and when collaboration is turned off. When collaboration is turned on, 
the user never needs to interact with&nbsp;any documents - he only chooses 
scripture books and chapters (see below). When collaboration is turned off for 
the same Adapt It project, the user will see&nbsp;and interact with only 
non-collaboration documents using the "Select a Document" page of the wizard.<br><br>The third option for entering a 
project is designed for advisors and consultants&nbsp;to use. It is labeled 
"Read-only mode (All texts accessible but not editable - I'm an advisor or 
consultant)". When this option is selected, collaboration mode remains off and 
the "Select a Document" page of the wizard appears. In this case all documents, 
both collaboration documents (whose names begin with "_Collab...") and 
non-collaboration documents will appear in the list of&nbsp;documents, and any 
of them can be opened. However,&nbsp;with this third option in effect, all 
documents opened will be in read-only mode. This mode is designed so that an 
advisor or consultant can view the user's work without risk of making any 
unintended changes. When in this mode, the background of the main Adapt It 
window will be pink as a reminder that read-only mode is in effect and any 
changes made in that mode cannot be saved, but will be lost when the document is 
closed.</p>
<p>When the user selects "Work with my Bibledit Scripture 
texts (Collaboration on)",&nbsp;after a short pause the following collaboration 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" width="550" height="300" ></p>
<p>This is the main dialog that the user will see when 
collaboration is turned on&nbsp;for the given project. From this simple dialog 
the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. The dialog 
shows a list of the scripture books available in Bibledit's Source Project. It 
also shows the chapters for the book together with information about the status 
of the target text as it is currently stored in Bibledit's Target Project. The 
user can select any Bibledit book and chapter to work on.&nbsp;When OK is 
clicked, Adapt It automatically fetches the&nbsp;source text and any existing 
target text from&nbsp;Bibledit and displays them in Adapt It's main window, 
ready to continue the adaptation process. When work is saved within Adapt 
It,&nbsp;Adapt It automatically transfers the&nbsp;saved target translation back 
to the appropriate Bibledit project. If a Bibledit project is set up for storing 
free translations, those are also saved in the appropriate Bibledit project.</p>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and 
then moving the results to Bibledit involved a lot of manual work -- copying and 
joining chapter files together into whole books and copying them back and forth 
between Adapt It and Bibledit. Not any more! Adapt It knows how to handle the 
consolidation of books into chapters and how to break books into chapters. All 
the details and organization of files are processed behind the scenes and 
invisible to the user. During collaboration work the user never needs to 
navigate around in the computer's file system and never needs to find or copy or 
move files.</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It works in collaboration with 
Bibledit, it not only transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Bibledit 
projects -- it also maintains its own collaboration project in the computer's 
"Adapt It Unicode Work" folder (or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode 
version). If the the Adapt It project has already been established and work has 
already been done in the two languages, the collaboration project can take 
advantage of the previously developed&nbsp;project knowledge base. The 
collaboration project continues to develop the knowledge base. You should be 
aware however that you can not continue to work on previously created documents 
while Adapt It is in collaboration mode. Collaboration mode must turned off to 
work in standard Adapt It documents.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Setup_User_Workflow_Profile"></a>Set up a User Workflow Profile</h2>
<p>Adapt It has many menu items and features to choose 
from. Such choices may be bewildering to a new user or inexperienced user. Adapt 
It now allows an administrator to control which choices appear in the program's 
interface, and which others remain hidden until such time as they may be needed. 
To activate a user workflow profile, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make 
the&nbsp;Administrator menu visible</a> , then select User Workflow Profiles... 
menu item.&nbsp;The following dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/User_workflow_profiles.gif" width="400" height="429" > </p>
<p>This dialog organizes Adapt It's menu selections, 
Preferences tabs, Mode bar items, and&nbsp;Tool bar items into four lists or 
"profiles"&nbsp;that correspond&nbsp;to the four tabs at the top of the dialog. 
Those tabs or profiles are labeled "Novice", "Experienced", "Skilled" and 
"Custom." The list in each tab all contain the same list of items, but we've 
pre-selected certain items on each list that we think should be visible for that 
profile, and un-selected those items that we think would be good to remain 
hidden for the given profile. The Novice profile starts with most of the listed 
items hidden (un-ticked). The Experienced profile makes a few more items visible 
in the interface (by ticking&nbsp;more items). The Skilled profile makes many 
more interface items visible (by ticking even more items).</p>
<p>Our suggestions are only a starting point; each profile 
can be further customized by you, the administrator, to your liking and 
according to your knowledge of the skills and needs of the user. If you select 
the fourth tab labeled "Custom" Adapt It will ask you if you want to initialize 
the selections from one of the other three profiles as a starting point 
--&nbsp;from which you may continue to customize which interface items are to be 
shown (ticked), and which should be hidden (un-ticked).</p>
<p>The default profile&nbsp;setting is "<strong>None</strong> (keep all menus and settings visible)". If 
you want to use a workflow profile, you first need to click the radio button 
labeled, "<strong>Use a workflow profile</strong> (select 
from drop down list below)". This selection enables the drop down box located 
below it. Only one profile can be selected at a given time for the user. You can 
select the desired profile by using the drop down box which will allow 
you&nbsp;to select the Novice, Experienced, Skilled or the Custom profile. Then, 
to make the interface start using a selected profile click on the "Save Changes" 
button.</p>
<p>At any time you can come back to the User Workflow 
Profiles dialog and switch to a different profile or adjust the individual items 
that should be visible or hidden for a given profile, and save the changes.</p>
<p>If you modified the items in a given profile, and now 
want to revert&nbsp;that profile to its "factory defaults" you can do so by 
first selecting that profile in the drop down box, and then clicking on&nbsp;the 
"Revert to factory defaults" button. If the "Revert to factory defaults" button 
is disabled, it means that you have not changed the viewing status of any 
individual item in that profile's list.</p>
<p>To stop using&nbsp;a user profile, simply click on the 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menu and settings 
visible)" radio button. Adapt It will remember your settings in case you later 
decide to reactivate a workflow profile that you set up previously. As an 
administrator you might want to temporarily turn OFF the current user profile, 
in order to be able to access all of the interface items while examining the 
user's computer. This can now be done via the "Turn OFF the current user profile 
temporarily" menu item located in the same group as the User Wrokflow 
Profiles... menu item on the Administrator menu.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs"></a>Pre-Assign locations for the various kinds of inputs 
and outputs</h2>
<p>Some computer users find it difficult or confusing to 
navigate through a hierarchical file system. They often are not sure where the 
files are located that they need to open, or where to save or export files from 
Adapt It. They may get lost navigating around the file system inside a file 
browser. They may not really know what a file would be called that they are 
looking for, nor what a file should be called when saving or exporting data from 
Adapt It. Adapt It 6 now allows you the administrator to pre-assign locations 
for any and all the kinds of inputs and outputs that can be done by a user. We 
call this a way to "protect" a user from having to do any navigation of the file 
system in order to get his work done.</p>
<p>Adapt It now allows you the administrator, to pre-assign 
locations for Adapt It's inputs and outputs, and therefore protect the user from 
having to compose file names and from having to navigate the file system to find 
or save files. To activate these protections, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make the Administrator 
menu visible</a>, then select the <strong>Assign Locations 
for Inputs and Outputs...</strong> menu item.</p>
<p>The main dialog appears, which looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_dlg_nothing_ticked.gif" width="500" height="292" > </p>
<p>By default none of the "Protect from Navigation" check 
boxes are ticked. Each of the names in upper case letters and starting 
with&nbsp;one or two&nbsp;initial _ underscore characters, are the names of a 
standard set of folders that Adapt It 6 automatically creates on the user's 
computer. These folder locations&nbsp; become the default location for the types 
of data described by the folder's names. If you as administrator, wish to 
"protect" that type of data, you can simply put a tick by as many folder 
locations as you want. If you want to protect all the types of data that Adapt 
It uses or exports, simply click on the "Protect All (Check All Boxes)" 
button.</p>
<p>A setup for a fully protected user (with Paratext 
collaboration turned ON) would look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs_all_checked.gif" width="500" height="292" > 
</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It is working in collaboration with 
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically limits the location&nbsp;for 
the&nbsp;source text inputs it obtains for adaptation work, and it also limits 
the locations where translation drafts are exported -- to the Paratext or 
Bibledit projects that are assigned during collaboration.&nbsp; Therefore, if 
you have previously set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, 
the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes to the right of __SOURCE_INPUTS and 
_TARGET_OUTPUTS will indicate (as shown in the dialog immediately 
above)&nbsp;that they are "Using Paratext project"; they will be automatically 
ticked and cannot be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, please understand that if Adapt It is 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, SOURCE texts can only be obtained from 
the Paratext or Bibledit projects, and Adapt It's TARGET texts (adapted 
translation drafts) are automatically transferred&nbsp; back to Paratext or 
Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>However, if your user will <strong>not</strong> be collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, 
you should consider at least selecting the "Protect from Navigation" for the 
__SOURCE_INPUTS folder. When this folder is "protected" the user will only see 
and be able to select from a list of input texts for adaptation that are located 
in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder. This can be a very helpful way to guide the user 
in what texts to use for adaptation. <strong>Since the user 
cannot obtain source text from anywhere else it is important that you, the 
advisor, pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder with the input texts that the user 
will need for his or her adaptation work</strong>. A convenient way to pre-load 
the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder, it to use the "<a href="#Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders" >Move or Copy Files Or 
Folders</a>" dialog from the Administrator menu. This dialog is designed like a 
"smart" file browser and knows what kind of files can be used for adaptation 
work.</p>
<p>When a folder location has "Protect from Navigation" 
activated, Adapt It will not ask the user for a file name nor allow the user to 
navigate to a different folder, but will automatically assign a file name to the 
input or output file, and read it from or store it to the indicated 
location.</p>
<p>The following information is a technical explanation of 
the way Adapt It handles the file naming process. You can safely ignore this 
section unless you are interested in the details or in the unlikely circumstance 
that the file processing does not work properly. In this case, the following 
information can be of value in finding out what went wrong and for conveying to 
the Adapt It what has happened to the computer.</p>
<p>When navigation protection is activated for a given 
input/output type, Adapt It automatically assigns names to files, it composes 
the name based on the type of the file's contents and adds a date-time "stamp" 
at the end of the name, and affixes the appropriate extension. This results in 
some long file names, but that is of no concern to the user, because when 
"Protect from Navigation" is activated the user doesn't have to interact with 
files or file names anyway. For example, the automatically composed name for an 
RTF export of the target text might look something like this:</p><strong>_Target_Text_45_ACT_CH02_exported_2011_07_11T14_25_53Z.rtf</strong> 

<p>and it would be located in the <strong>_TARGET_RTF_OUTPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It 
project. Because of the presence of the date-time stamp within the file name, 
there is never going to be a danger of files overwriting one another because all 
exported files will have unique, easily discernable&nbsp;names, and files with 
similar content will sort together in chronological order.</p>
<p>Note: The assignment of text type prefixes and/or 
date-time stamp suffixes on file names is not automatically done when navigation 
protection is OFF for a given input/output type, but it text type prefixes and 
date-time stamp suffixes can be used if desired at import/export time by ticking 
the appropriate check boxes on the dialog that appears.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the Assign Locations For Inputs 
and Outputs dialog to help keep your user's data organized into predictable 
locations and its files consistently named - so that they are easily identified 
as to content and&nbsp;creation date.</p>
<p>When Adapt It is setup for collaboration with Paratext 
or Bibledit, Adapt It keeps a copy of each chapter or book file that it obtains 
from Paratext/Bibledit - placing the copy in the <strong>__SOURCE_INPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project 
that is hooked up to Paratext/Bibledit during collaboration. The files that 
Adapt It puts in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder are named automatically by Adapt It, 
and will have a _Collab_ prefix on the name.&nbsp;A chapter file for chapter 2 
of the book of Matthew obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar 
to the following example:</p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.txt</strong> 
<p>If collaboration is done by&nbsp;whole book, a&nbsp;file 
obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to the following 
example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.txt</strong> 
</p>
<p>The adaptation documents that Adapt It creates - 
regardless of whether collaboration is ON or OFF, are still stored in the 
"<strong>Adaptations</strong>" folder of the Adapt It 
project. When collaboration is turned ON, those files are automatically named by 
Adapt It. The adaptation document for Matthew chapter 2 would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.xml</strong> </p>
<p>and the adaptation document for the whole book of 
Matthew would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.xml</strong> 
</p>
<p>in either case these xml formatted adaptation 
documents&nbsp;are always&nbsp;located in the <strong>Adaptations</strong> folder of the Adapt It project.</p>

<h2><a name="Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders"></a>Moving or copying files or folders.</h2>
<p>As an administrator you may have a need to move or copy 
files from within Adapt It. Adapt It 6 provides an "intelligent" file browser 
for administrative use. To get Adapt It's file browser, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >make the Administrator 
menu visible</a>, then select the "Move Or Copy Folders Or Files..." menu item. 
When you do so the following dual pane dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Move_or_Copy_Folders_or_Files.gif" width="500" height="311" > </p>
<p>Note that generally, if your users are going to be 
working&nbsp;with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, you 
probably do not need to worry about moving or copying files or folders for Adapt 
It's use. In collaboration work the main data you will be concerned about will 
be the data kept in the Paratext or Bibledit data store. In collaboration mode 
Adapt It becomes an adaptation engine for Paratext or Bibledit, and the 
scripture data essentially stays within the Paratext or Bibledit projects. Adapt 
It automatically&nbsp;makes copies of the data and creates its own project for 
the purposes of adaptation, and Adapt It automatically transfers its target 
texts (translation drafts) back to Paratext or Bibledit. Hence, all data is 
destined to start and end within the designated Paratext/Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>The above "intelligent" file browser can be helpful if 
you do not plan to work with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or 
Bibledit. In such cases, you can use this dialog to copy potential source texts 
into an Adapt It project's __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Setting_up_an_administrator_password"></a>Setting up an administrator password</h2>
<p>To access the Administrator menu you first need to make 
the Administrator menu visible. From within Adapt It click on the "Show 
Administrator Menu..." item on the View menu. For the password, you can always 
enter the <a name="default_password"></a>default password 
which is the word admin. You can also set your own password using the 
Administrator menu item for that purpose. The administrator password is not a 
highly guarded secret, but exists only to hinder inexperienced users from 
accessing the administrator menu and changing settings they should not be 
changing. If you set your own password it will be kept unencrypted in the basic 
configuration file AI-BasicConfiguration.aic located in the Adapt It Unicode 
Work folder (or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode application). If you 
forget your password, you can find it in the AI-BasicConfiguration.aic file, or 
you can simply use the default password mentioned above.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a> </p>
<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>What version of Balsa are you using? If you are using 
Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should already have Adapt It 
version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see if there are any recent 
updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x at the&nbsp;packages.sil.org repository. When 
the Lucid version of Balsa boots up, and you log on to the Balsa User account, 
the opening screen looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BalsaOpeningScreen.gif" width="500" height="293" > 
</p>
<p>The Lucid version of Balsa as shown above has Adapt It 
version 5.2.4. You will need Adapt It version 6.x.x in order to take advantage 
of its new features designed for assisting translation program administrators, 
and especially working in collaboration with the Balsa Scripture editor 
Bibledit. The icon for Adapt It version 6 looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ai_new_icon.gif" width="107" height="118" > <br><font face="Arial"><strong>Adapt It</strong></font> </p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
<strong>Advisor</strong> and <strong>Balsa User</strong>. <strong>You as an 
administrator need to log in first as Advisor</strong> to update Adapt It to its 
latest version 6 update which has many new features designed to assist you as an 
administrator. Then, once you have upgraded Adapt It to version 6, you should 
<strong>log off as Advisor</strong> and <strong>log back in as the</strong> <strong>Balsa User</strong> to complete the setup of Adapt It for 
that given user. Except for upgrading Adapt It to the latest version 6.x.x, all 
remaining setup of Adapt It should be done using the Balsa User account.</p>
<p><strong>Note: any data you create 
while logged into the Advisor account in Balsa&nbsp;does NOT appear within Adapt 
It when Balsa is logged into the Balsa User account, and likewise any 
data&nbsp;the user&nbsp;creates within Adapt It under the Balsa User 
account&nbsp;does not appear when logged into the Advisor account.</strong></p>
<p>The steps for doing these things are listed below:</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt 
It to version 6 (if needed)</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Advisor</strong> account in the Balsa system.<br>2. Run the <strong>Synaptic Package 
Manager</strong> by selecting it from the Applications &gt; System menu. In the 
Quick search box type the word adaptit. The "Installed" version of adaptit 
listed there should be at least 6.2.1. If the package manager doesn't indicate 
that version 6.2.x is already installed, you should go ahead and mark it for 
installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card form of Balsa, you probably will 
want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation (although please note 
that&nbsp;the adaptit-docs package&nbsp;is about 11MB of download). <br>3. After you have ensured that Adapt It version 6.2.x is 
installed, you can close the package manager and <strong>log off the Balsa Advisor account</strong>. Next you will 
need to log on to the Balsa User account (see below).</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Balsa 
User</strong> account.<br>2. On the "Work" desktop double 
click on the <strong>Adapt It icon</strong> to start up 
Adapt It.<br>3. Set up the necessary Bibledit projects for 
collaboration. You need at least two Bibledit projects: One for obtaining source 
texts, and one for receiving translation (target text) drafts.<br>4. Access Adapt It's <strong>Administrator menu</strong> (see how to access the 
Administrator menu <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password" >here</a>).<br>5. After creating the Bibledit projects (step 3), set up 
Adapt it to collaborate with Bibledit (follow the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Bibledit</a> section of this document for 
detailed steps).<br>6. Assign locations for inputs and 
outputs using the dialog for that purpose. It is recommended that you tick all 
of the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes. See <a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs" >this 
section</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<p align="left">If your user(s) will be using Balsa for one 
type of collaboration project you might consider setting up dedicated 
launcher(s).</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc" >Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Setup_custom_work_folder"></a>Set up a custom work folder (Optional)</h2>
<p>For most users you should just allow Adapt It to create 
and maintain its default "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder (or "Adapt It Work" for 
the non-Unicode version) in the default location. For Windows systems, Adapt It 
will by default create this folder in the user's "Documents" (or "My Documents") 
folder. For Linux systems this work folder will be created in the 
/home/&lt;user&gt; folder. On Mac systems this folder will be created in the 
/Users/&lt;user&gt; folder.</p>
<p>In some cases you may want Adapt It to use a custom work 
folder in a non-default location -- such as on a different disk partition, or in 
a different folder than the default location. You can use the Administrator 
menu's "Custom Work Folder..." item to assign the location where Adapt It will 
establish its work folder. When you select "Custom Work Folder", Adapt 
It&nbsp;displays a standard dialog in which you can navigate to the location 
where you want Adapt It to establish its work folder.</p>
<p>Adapt It will remember&nbsp;any custom work 
folder&nbsp;location that you specify --&nbsp;until such time as you, the 
administrator specify a different location or choose "Restore Default Work 
Folder Location" from the Administrator menu. If you establish a custom work 
folder location Adapt It will offer to lock it in that location. If you choose 
not to lock it in that location, Adapt It will only continue using that location 
for the current work session.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that if you create a custom work 
folder and then change back to the default work folder, none of the work done in 
the custom folder transfers to the default folder. The same is true in the other 
direction. You as the administrator are responsible to make those file transfers 
if they are needed. For this reason, the Adapt It team recommends that custom 
work folders are used rarely and if you choose to do so, you use them 
consistently instead of the default folders.</p>

<h2><a name="Guidelines_for_training_users"></a>Guidelines for training Adapt It users</h2>
<h3>Preparations for Collaboration Work (with Paratext or 
Bibledit)</h3>
<p>* <strong>Prepare the 
Paratext/Bibledit projects.</strong> You as Administrator should prepare the 
Paratext/Bibledit projects <strong>BEFORE</strong> setting 
up Adapt It collaboration. You should make sure that <a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start" >Paratext</a> or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Bibledit</a> has <strong>at least TWO projects</strong> :</p>
<p>1. A project that contains the source language texts 
from which Adapt It will obtain its source texts for adaptation work. Preferably 
this Paratext/Bibledit project should contain all the available source texts 
that will be used in collaboration. </p>
<p>2. You also should make sure that Paratext or Bibledit 
has a <strong>different</strong> project created which will 
receive the adapted translation drafts produced by Adapt It. </p>
<p>If your user will be preparing free translations, you 
should also create a third project in Paratext/Bibledit to receive free 
translations. The books you create in the Paratext/Bibledit projects for 
receiving the target text&nbsp;and free translations can be empty but 
they&nbsp;should be created with (empty) chapter and verse numbers. Ensure that 
the (empty) books created correspond to the books that exist in the source 
language project.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup Paratext/Bibledit 
Collaboration.</strong> You as Administrator should setup collaboration using 
the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration..." menu item on the Adapt It 
Administrator menu.&nbsp;Using that Adapt It dialog, designate the 
Paratext/Bibledit projects that are to be used for a given Adapt It project. You 
can set configure different collaboration settings for different Adapt It 
projects. This ensures that the user will not have to do any setup, but can 
simply start working by selecting the Adapt It project to enter, choosing 
whether to turn collaboration on or off, and if collaboration is on, choosing 
the book and chapter to work on. After configuring Adapt It projects for 
collaboration, you should ensure that things are working correctly by doing what 
the user would do: select an Adapt It project from the opening page of the Start 
Working wizard, choosing to turn collaboration on (or off) for that project, and 
if collaboration is turned on, selecting a scripture book and a chapter from the 
"Get Source Text from Paratext/Bibledit Project dialog". If you get any errors, 
see the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration" >Trouble Shooting</a> topic.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup a user workflow 
profile.</strong> You as Administrator should carefully consider the skill and 
experience of&nbsp;the user, and determine if one of Adapt It's pre-configured 
<a href="#Setup_User_Workflow_Profile" >user workflow profiles</a> would be 
appropriate&nbsp;for&nbsp;a given&nbsp;user. You can establish a user profile 
using the Administrator menu's "User Workflow Profiles..." menu item. The 
<strong>Novice</strong> user profile hides most menu items 
and options that are not absolutely necessary for basic adaptation work. The 
<strong>Experienced</strong> and <strong>Skilled</strong> profiles enable more menu items and 
interface options. You can also customize any of the profiles or design your own 
profile using the <strong>Custom</strong> user profile. If 
you decide to use a profile, you should practice using Adapt It yourself with 
that profile in force, or at least closely watch the user working with that user 
profile in effect, to make sure that the options that remain visible&nbsp;are 
suitable for the skills and the work expected of that user. You don't want to 
hide options that a user really will need to do his job.</p>
<p>* <strong>Assign Locations for 
Inputs and Outputs.</strong> During collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, 
Adapt It automatically limits the locations for source text inputs and target 
text outputs to the Paratext or Bibledit project being used in collaboration. 
But, Adapt It is able to do other kinds of inputs and exports. You as 
Administrator, should decide whether your user should be "protected" from the 
possibility of getting inputs from the wrong place, and exporting outputs to the 
wrong place. Without such protection files can get lost or misplaced. We suggest 
that you&nbsp;select all of the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes in the "<a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs" >Assign Locations for 
Inputs and Outputs</a>" dialog. When the "Protect from Navigation" check box is 
ticked, Adapt It will automatically name and locate files for that particular 
type of input or output, placing the files within Adapt It's special 
folders.</p>
<p>* <strong>Check the settings in 
Adapt It's Preferences dialog.</strong> The Preferences dialog is accessible 
from the <strong>Edit </strong>menu with a document loaded 
for collaboration. You as Administrator should ensure that Adapt It is 
using&nbsp;the correct <strong>Fonts</strong>, <strong>Punctuation</strong>, and any <strong>Case equivalences</strong>&nbsp;for the languages involved 
in the collaboration work. Use the tabs in the Preferences dialog to make any 
needed changes.</p>
<h3>Training points for Collaboration Work (with Paratext 
or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>Once you have done the necessary preparations as 
described in the "Preparations for Collaboration Work" section above, you should 
provide some supervised training in the use of Adapt It. Your training should 
include the following:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;<strong>Supervised 
"hands-on" adaptation work with the actual texts of the collaboration 
project.</strong> There is a document supplied with Adapt It installations 
called "Adapt It Tutorial.doc". Chapter 1 of that Tutorial contains information 
that is focused on situations where&nbsp;Adapt It is set up to work with texts 
apart from collaboration scenarios. It covers information that you as 
administrator might find helpful, but the user will not need to understand to 
work in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit. However, chapter 2&nbsp;of the 
Adapt It Tutorial.doc is called "Working on a document", and contains good 
information and exercises. You will want to adapt the&nbsp;information 
and&nbsp;procedures demonstrated there to your actual collaboration texts. 
Hence, you should help the user practice using actual texts in the collaboration 
project&nbsp;until s/he feels comfortable working with Adapt It. The knowledge 
and adaptation skills that treated in the tutorial and that are important for 
the user to develop are:</p>
<p>1. Understanding the parts of Adapt It's main window 
(menus, toolbar, modebar, layout of strips, piles).<br>2. 
Positioning the phrase box, typing text into it, pressing Enter to advance 
it.<br>3. Merging source words to make a source phrase.<br>4. Unmerging a source phrase.<br>5. 
Accepting a default adaptation without changes.<br>6. 
Retranslating a section of source text; removing or editing a retranslation.<br>7. Inserting an extra word or phrase; removing inserted 
words or phrases.<br>8. Reading your translation without 
the source text being shown.<br>9. Single-step mode versus 
Automatic mode.<br>10. When there are multiple translations 
- the Choose Translation dialog.<br>11. Leaving a source 
word untranslated - three kinds of "nothing".</p>
<p>There is also a more comprehensive "Adapt It 
Reference.doc" document which you may find helpful.</p>
<p>* <strong>Getting texts by "Chapter 
Only"</strong> is the default method of exchanging texts with Paratext or 
Bibledit. You as administrator can select to "Get Chapter Only" or "Get Whole 
Book" within your "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration" dialog accessible from 
the Administrator menu. However, we recommend that you leave the default set as 
"Get Chapter Only". Single chapter chunks load and save more quickly than whole 
books such as the Gospels and Acts. Since Adapt It organizes everything and 
automatically does all transfers between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit, 
there is no logistical&nbsp;problem for the user to work chapter by chapter. 
Even when working chapter by chapter, Adapt It automatically transfers the 
chapter's translation work back into the whole books when Adapt It saves the 
translation work. In any case, you should not change between collaborating by 
Chapter Only and Whole Book for a given book. If adapting chapter-by-chapter, 
the user should continue working chapter-by-chapter until the whole book is 
finished.</p>
<p>* <strong>Reporting Problems and 
Giving Feedback</strong>. Adapt It is provided free of charge under an open 
source license. The developers are quick to respond to email reports of problems 
and requests. They depend on the reports of any problems as well as feedback 
from field users to improve Adapt It. Before reporting problems to the 
developers, please have a look at the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration" >Trouble 
Shooting</a> topic below. If that does not help you resolve the problem, feel 
free to contact the developers either via email or via the "Report a Problem..." 
selection in Adapt It's help menu (see below).</p>
<p>Adapt It version 6 now has an easy to use email 
reporting feature - located on the Adapt It Help menu. Just click on the Help 
menu item labeled "<strong>Report a Problem...</strong>" 
and Adapt It will display the following dialog - with much of the information 
already filled in:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Report_a_problemDlg.gif" width="400" height="396" > 
</p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and a brief description of the steps to reproduce the 
problem, using the text in the edit box as a guide for your comments. If a 
document is open that illustrates the problem, just click on the "Attach the 
document (packed)" button to include a copy of the packed document along with 
the report. If you have access to the Internet, you can click on the "Send Now" 
button to send your report. Adapt It also saves a copy of your report in the 
_LOGS_EMAIL_REPORTS folder located in its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder. The 
usage log is automatically included in the email report (unless you untick the 
check box). It would likely provide information and possible error messages that 
would help us understand the cause of any problem.</p>
<p>There is also a Help menu item called "<strong>Give Feedback...</strong>". The form looks similar to the 
form for reporting a problem, but is provided to make giving feedback easier to 
do via email:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Give_Feedback.gif" width="400" height="396" ></p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and your feedback in the edit box provided. Use the 
text in the box as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: Adapt It sends all such emails to the developers 
using secured SSL encryption directly from the Adapt It program, so email 
communications are done safely. The user's computer does not have to have an 
email client installed to send these reports.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Adapt It Desktop Launchers For Specific Work 
Scenarios (using command-line switches/options)</h2>
<p>This section describes how to set up desktop icons or 
"launchers" to make it easy for users to start up Adapt It for a given work 
session. It also describes how you can configure a launcher with a command-line 
switch/option that forces Adapt It to run with in a certain mode for the work 
session. First, we provide a description of the command-line options and how 
they work. Afterwards we provide information on how to setup desktop launchers 
for typical Windows and Linux (including Balsa) systems.<br></p>
<h3><a name="command_line_switches"></a>The command-line switches:</h3>
<p><b>-xo</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the <b>-xo</b> switch can be used to force Adapt It to accommodate 
the unusual screen density (DPI), font and bitmap handling of the One Laptop Per 
Child (OLPC) XO computer. This switch forces Adapt It to use double-sized bitmap 
images in its tool bar, and a double line of controls on its mode bar. This 
arrangement helps to make the tool bar buttons more accessible and the mode bar 
items more likely to fit within the screen on an XO computer.</p>
<p><b>-wf</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the <b>-wf</b> switch/option can be used to force Adapt It to 
always use a specified folder path for its work folder. The -wf switch must be 
followed by the absolute folder path to be used for Adapt It's work folder. 
Ordinarily Adapt It's work folder would be located at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C:\Users\&lt;userName&gt;\Documents\Adapt It Unicode 
Work\</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; on recent versions of Windows systems (Windows Vista and 
Windows 7)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/home/&lt;userName&gt;/Adapt It Unicode Work/ </b>&nbsp; on 
most distributions of Linux systems<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/Users/&lt;userName&gt;/Adapt It Unicode Work/ </b>&nbsp; 
on Macintosh OS X systems<br>The -wf switch could be used 
to force Adapt It to place its project folders in a non-standard location such 
as in a /data/ folder of an external thumb drive. For example, on Windows the 
work folder location might be at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>E:\data\</b><br>and the command-line 
Target for this in a launcher would be:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"C:\Program Files\Adapt It WX Unicode\Adapt_It_Unicode.exe" 
-wf E:\data\<br>Note: Command-line switches/options that 
include paths or file names containing spaces must be enclosed in double quote 
marks.</b></p>
<p><strong>-frm</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <b>-frm</b> switch can be used to force Adapt It to operate 
only in reviewing mode. This switch should only be used in special circumstances 
in which you want the user to produce a very literal gloss or adaptation for the 
source text. In Reviewing mode Adapt It does not supply adaptations 
automatically nor jump to the next available hole in the translation. In this 
mode Adapt It's knowledge base does not store the adaptations that are being 
typed in by the user. It also does not automatically do any lookups or offer any 
translation equivalents as the user works. This mode therefore forces the user 
to type in a gloss or adaptation for every source text word or phrase. This 
switch/mode is being used in places where the administrator feels that a 
translator does not yet have enough training to be able to interpret potential 
translational renderings that Adapt It might enter automatically from its 
knowledge base.</p>
<p>[Other command-line switches may be added in a future 
version of Adapt It]</p>
<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in Windows</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Install Adapt It version 
6.2.1 or newer</strong>.<br>2. Open Windows Explorer and 
navigate to the Adapt It installation folder, and click on the Adapt It program 
executable file,&nbsp;normally located&nbsp;at <strong>c:\Program Files\Adapt It WX 
Unicode\Adapt_It_Unicode.exe</strong> for the Unicode version, or <strong>c:\Program Files\Adapt It WX\Adapt_It.exe</strong> for the 
Regular (ANSI) version.<br>3. Right-click on the 
Adapt_It_Unicode.exe (or Adapt_It.exe) file and select "<strong>Send To</strong>" &gt; "<strong>Desktop (create shortcut)</strong>".<br>4. Close or minimize&nbsp;Windows Explorer and any other 
programs so you can see the shortcut that was created in the previous step. 
<strong>Right-click</strong> on that shortcut and select 
"<strong>Rename</strong>". Then enter a brief name for this 
launcher, possibly something like "Peter's Adapt It work". The launcher name 
should be short but&nbsp;worded so that the user(s) can distinguish this 
launcher from any others you plan to create for other work scenarios.<br>5. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the 
desktop shortcut and select "<strong>Properties</strong> ". 
You should see a Shortcut properties dialog that looks something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Windows_shortcut_properties.gif" width="300" height="424" > </p>
<p>6. If a command-line switch is desired for this 
launcher, it would be added at the end of the existing text that is in the 
"<strong>Target</strong>" edit box (with an intervening 
space). Press the right arrow key or click in the box to remove the highlight, 
but keep the existing text there in the edit box. If you want to add a 
command-line switch, add a space at the end of the existing text path <strong>after the last quote mark</strong>, and then <strong>type the command-line option, for example</strong>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<font face="Courier"><strong>-wf e:\data<br></strong></font><font face="Times New Roman">7. Click on OK to save and close the Shortcut Properties 
dialog. Your desktop launcher is now ready to use. <br>8.&nbsp;Double-click the newly created 
desktop&nbsp;shortcut icon&nbsp;labeled "Peter's Adapt It work" to launch Adapt 
It. Adapt It will start running and if a command-line switch was used it will be 
forced to run in the desired mode.<br>9. To create other 
launchers for different Adapt It work scenarios, follow steps 2 through 8 above, 
adjusting the name of the desktop launcher in step 4, and any command-line 
switch/option used in step 6 according to the work scenario you want the 
launcher to run.</font> </p>
<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in Linux (Ubuntu)</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Install Adapt It version 
6.2.1 or newer for your Linux distribution</strong>.<br>2. 
If you are using the classic Gnome interface, click on <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Office</strong>, and <strong>right-click</strong> on the <strong>Adapt It</strong> menu item, and select "<strong>Add this launcher to desktop</strong>".<br>3. If you are using the newer Gnome Unity interface, click 
on the Ubuntu Dash home icon to open the panel, and type "adaptit" into the 
search bar at the top. When the Adapt It icon appears click on it and drag it to 
an empty area of your desktop.<br>4. Close or minimize any 
other programs so you can see the desktop shortcut that was created in the 
previous step. <strong>Right-click</strong> on that 
shortcut and select "<strong>Rename...</strong>". Then 
enter a brief name for this launcher, possibly something like "Peter's Adapt 
It&nbsp;work". The launcher name should be short but worded so that the user(s) 
can distinguish this launcher from any others you plan to create for other work 
scenarios.<br>5. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the desktop shortcut and select 
"<strong>Properties</strong> ". You should see an Adapt It 
Properties dialog that looks something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Linux_shortcut_properties.gif" width="500" height="435" > </p>
<p>6. If a command-line switch is desired for this 
launcher, it would be added to the end of the existing text that is in the 
"<strong>Command</strong>" edit box (with an intervening 
space). Press the right arrow key or click in the box to remove the highlight, 
but keep the existing text there in the edit box. If you want to add a 
command-line switch, add a space at the end of the existing text path <strong>after the last quote mark</strong>, and then <strong>type the command-line option, for example</strong>:<br><font face="Courier"><strong>-frm<br></strong></font><font 
face="Times New Roman">7. Click on&nbsp;the Close 
button&nbsp;to save and close the Adapt It Properties dialog. Your desktop 
launcher is now ready to use. <br>8. Double-click the newly 
created desktop shortcut icon labeled "Peter's Adapt It work" to launch Adapt 
It. Adapt It will start running and if a command-line switch was used it will be 
forced to run in the desired mode.<br>9. To create other 
launchers for different Adapt It work scenarios, follow steps 2 through 8 above, 
adjusting the name of the desktop launcher in step 4, and any&nbsp; command-line 
switch/option used in step 6 according to the work scenario you want the 
launcher to run. </font>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Setting up desktop launchers in&nbsp;Balsa (Lucid)</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Log on to the Advisor 
Balsa account and install Adapt It version 6.2.1 or newer for your&nbsp;Lucid 
distribution</strong>. <br>2. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the desktop and choose "<strong>Create Launcher...</strong>". The Balsa system displays the 
"Create Launcher" dialog which looks like this:<br><br></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Balsa_create_launcher.gif" width="400" height="361" ></p>
<p><br><br>3. In 
the "Name:" edit box,&nbsp;enter a brief name for this launcher, possibly 
something like "Peter's Adapt It work". The launcher name should be short but 
worded so that the user(s) can distinguish this launcher from any others you 
plan to create for other work scenarios.<br>4. The 
"Command:" edit box is where&nbsp;you construct the&nbsp;command-line to launch 
Adapt It along any desired command-line switch/option. Click on the folder icon 
at the right end of the "Command:" edit box. A "Select an Application" dialog 
comes up that lists the available applications. Scroll down a little&nbsp;to the 
<strong>adaptit</strong> item, select it, and click the 
"Open" button. The system enters <strong>/usr/bin/adaptit</strong> into the "Command:" edit box.<br>5. If a command-line switch is desired for this launcher, 
it would be added to the end of the existing text that is in the "<strong>Command</strong>" edit box (with an intervening space). 
Press the right arrow key or click in the box to remove the highlight, but keep 
the existing text there in the edit box. If you want to add a command-line 
switch, add a space at the end of the existing text path <strong>after the last quote mark</strong>, and then <strong>type the command-line option, for example</strong>:<br><font face="Courier"><strong>-xo<br></strong></font><font 
face="Times New Roman">6. Click on the "No icon" button, 
and select the Adapt It icon from the list of application icons, and click OK. 
The Adapt It icon appears in place of the button. You can also enter a comment 
into the "Comment:" edit box if you want to. It will appear as a tool tip when 
the mouse hovers over the launcher.<br>7. Tick the "Use 
startup notification" check box.</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>8. Click on the Create button to 
create the launcher. Your desktop launcher&nbsp;has now been created and is 
located on the Advisor's Desktop. But there is more work to do to install this 
launcher on the Balsa User's desktop along with the default launchers already 
located there.<br>9. If you can see the newly created 
launcher on the Advisor's desktop go to the next step. If you cannot see the 
newly created launcher on the Advisor's Desktop, you may need to temporarily 
reduce the size of your desktop icons. Right-click on the Desktop and select 
"Desktop Settings..." and click on the "Icon" tab in the Desktop dialog. Under 
"Appearance" reduce the icon size value there to 64 or smaller, and click the 
"Close" button. Now you should be able to see the launcher you created on the 
Advisor's Desktop.<br>10. Right-click on the desktop 
launcher you created, and select <strong>Open with 
"gedit"</strong>. Change the Categories= line so that it reads: <strong>Categories=GTK;Office;</strong> making sure that the two 
words following the = sign end with a semi-colon character <strong>;<br></strong>11. Click on the <strong>File &gt; Save</strong> and then <strong>File &gt; Close</strong> to exit from the gedit editor.<br>12. <strong>Log out of the Advisor 
account and log on to the Balsa User account.<br></strong>13. In the Balsa User account click on the 
Documents icon to start up the File Manager. <br>14. 
Navigate into the File System and find the <strong>/home/advisor/Desktop</strong> folder. In that folder you 
should see the desktop launcher you created earlier while logged into the 
Advisor account.<br>15. Click on the desktop launcher to 
select it and do <strong>Edit &gt; Copy</strong>.<br>16. Navigate back to the <strong>/home/balsa/.local/share/applications</strong> folder and 
do <strong>Edit &gt; Paste</strong>.<br>17. <strong>Log out of the&nbsp;Balsa 
User&nbsp;account and log on to the Balsa Advisor account.<br></strong>18. Double-click on the "<strong>Edit Tabbed Desktop</strong>" icon, and select the "<strong>Balsa User</strong>" item in the popup dialog, and click 
OK. Enter the Advisor password <strong>admin123456</strong> 
and OK. This action starts up the "<strong>Main 
Menu</strong>" editor.<br>19. In the Main Menu editor 
navigate to the <strong>Applications &gt; All Apps &gt; 
Office folder</strong>. You should see there the launcher that you pasted there 
in step 16 above.<br>20. Click on the name of the launcher 
to select it (make sure the check box has a tick in the box).<br>21. Scroll the left hand list up so you can see the "Work" 
menu under Applications. Now back in the Items: list <strong>drag the selected launcher</strong> across to the "Work" 
menu <strong>dropping it directly onto the "Work" menu 
item</strong>. You should ensure that the background of the "Work" shows a 
dotted box before you drop the&nbsp;launcher on that item. Select the "Work" 
item to ensure that your launcher is now in that menu list (you may need to 
scroll down to see it). If it is not there, try the drag and drop action again 
until you see&nbsp;your launcher appear in the list of items under 
the&nbsp;"Work" menu. Note: The ordering of items in the "Work" menu list is the 
order the launchers will appear in the User's Desktop. On small computer 
screens, not all of the launchers listed there may be seen when viewing the 
User's Desktop. If that is the case you can return to the Main Menu editor and 
adjust the order of the icons so that those the need to be seen are up higher in 
the list.<br>22. You can now&nbsp;<strong>Log out of the Advisor account and log on to the Balsa User 
account</strong>. You should now see your launcher on the Balsa User's Desktop. 
<br>23. Double-click the newly created desktop shortcut 
icon labeled "Peter's Adapt It work" to launch Adapt It. Adapt It will start 
running and automatically and if a command-line switch was added, will use 
whatever mode that may have been forced by a command-line switch/option.<br>24. To create other launchers for different Adapt It work 
scenarios, follow the above steps for each new launcher you create, adjusting 
the&nbsp;specific properties&nbsp;of the desktop launcher and any command-line 
switch you want the launcher to force Adapt It to use when it runs.</font> </p>

<h2><a name="trouble_shooting_collaboration"></a>Trouble Shooting</h2>
<h3>Problems in Collaboration with Paratext</h3>
<p>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it 
uses to exchange data between Adapt It and Paratext. Adapt It installs a utility 
program called <strong>rdwrtp7.exe</strong> that it 
attempts to execute when collaborating with Paratext on Windows systems. 
Ordinarily you need not worry about these utility programs. However, we have not 
been able to test these utility programs on all possible computer system 
configurations and architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Paratext, it is likely that the problem could 
be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to account for between your 
computer system and the version of the utility program installed by Adapt 
It.</p>
<p>When the Paratext development team releases a new 
version of Paratext, and you have upgraded to the newer version, you should 
insure that Adapt It can still collaborate with the newer&nbsp;version of 
Paratext. If you encounter a problem with Adapt It - Paratext collaboration 
after updating your Paratext installation, please let us know so we can provide 
an Adapt It update that will correct the problem. Such problems are not very 
likely to happen between Adapt It and Paratext, but if they do happen it is most 
likely they would happen after a fairly major update of either Paratext or Adapt 
It. Please write down the text of any error messages that appear, and include 
those with any problem reports you send us. If you have Internet access you can 
try submitting a report directly from Adapt It (see the "Report a Problem..." 
selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a report via regular email - 
our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About Adapt It..." selection on the 
Help menu.</p>
<h3>Problems in Collaboration with Bibledit</h3>
<p>Note: Most problems in collaboration between Adapt It 
and Bibledit can be solved by ensuring that your version of Adapt It is at least 
version 6.2.1 and your version of Bibledit is at least 4.3. See the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start" >Step 1 of the Bibledit setup process</a>. 
If you have done all the setup steps for Bibledit, but are still having 
problems, the information below may be of some help.</p>
<p>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it 
uses to exchange data between Adapt It and Bibledit. There are different utility 
programs for different computer architectures (32-bit, 64-bit, etc.) and Ubuntu 
distributions. Bibledit version 4.3 and newer installs an executable file called 
<strong>bibledit-rdwrt</strong> for collaboration with 
Bibledit on Linux systems. Ordinarily you need not worry about this utility 
program. However, we have not been able to test these utility programs on all 
possible computer system configurations, and especially on different Linux 
distributions/architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit, it is likely that the problem could 
be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to account for between your 
computer system and the version of the utility program installed by Adapt It. If 
you still find that collaboration with Bibledit is failing, please 
inform&nbsp;the Adapt It developers about the problem, so we can find a solution 
and possibly make a corrected version available in a future&nbsp;update. Please 
write down the text of any error messages that appear, and include that 
information&nbsp;with any problem reports you send us. If you have Internet 
access you can try submitting a report directly from Adapt It (see the "Report a 
Problem..." selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a report via 
regular email - our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About Adapt It..." 
selection on the Help menu. Please include&nbsp;what distribution of Ubuntu 
you&nbsp;are running&nbsp;and whether it is a 32-bit (i386) or 64-bit (amd64) 
system, plus any other details you think might help us to provide a 
fix.&nbsp;Detailed information about your system&nbsp;should be 
available&nbsp;by accessing&nbsp;your System Info (via System &gt;Administration 
&gt; System Monitor, or System Settings &gt; System Info on 
Unity).&nbsp;</p>
