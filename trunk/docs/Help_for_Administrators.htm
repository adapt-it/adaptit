<h1 align="center">Help for Adapt It Administrators</h1>
<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is shown and accessed under password 
control. Although you can assign a password for accessing the Administrator 
menu, the <a href="#default_password">default password</a> will always work to 
make the Administrator menu visible.</p>
<p>                  
             
     The Adapt It team highly recommends that you 
take advantage of the Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful 
setup can make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and 
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> .</p>

<h2><a

Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a 
href="http://#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="http://#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>            
        . Here are the 
steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>1. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext, you should insure that Paratext has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>. These projects should be set up, complete with books either imported or 
created within Paratext BEFORE you set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext. 
Note: The books for the translation drafts and/or free translations should 
exist in the Paratext projects, even though they may be empty of text&nbsp;- 
such "empty" books should have&nbsp;chapter and verse usfm markers present.</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 419px; HEIGHT: 415px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=419 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/PTNewProject.gif" width=400 height=381></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and Settings"&nbsp; 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table><br>IMPORTANT: From within Paratext's 
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong> dialog you should ensure that 
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly for each project that Adapt 
It will collaborate with. It is the <strong>Language</strong> setting in the 
above dialog where the Paratext language of the "source" and "target" (and "free 
translation") projects are determined within Paratext. Press the 
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a unique&nbsp;language 
name for each project. Therefore, if the 
Paratext&nbsp;project&nbsp;uses&nbsp;<strong>Swahili</strong> in the "source" 
project's Language 
field, and&nbsp; <strong> English</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;"target texts" 
project,&nbsp;then Adapt It will assume that&nbsp;its own collaboration project 
should be&nbsp;named "<strong>  Swahili&nbsp;to&nbsp;English 
adaptations</strong>". When set up for collaboration, Adapt It will use any Adapt 
It project that&nbsp;already exists by that name, or if an&nbsp;Adapt It project&nbsp;by 
that name does not already exist,&nbsp;it will create a new one by that name in 
its own work folder ("Adapt It Unicode Work" in the Unicode version, or "Adapt 
It Work" in the non-Unicode version).</p>
<h3>2. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width=300 height=240>  </p>
<p align="left">When you selecte "Setup Paratext Collaboration..." the following 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 407px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=389 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/SetupPTCollabWithoutLangNamesCtrls.gif" width=500 
      height=350></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up Paratext Collaboration" 
  dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p> <br>You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on 
this dialog:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Before doing any other setup you 
must <strong>verify that the Paratext projects have already been created within 
Paratext</strong>             
     . A minumum of at least two Paratext 
projects are required: One Paratext project for obtaining source texts for 
adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different Paratext project to receive the 
adaptated texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free 
translation in addition to an adaptation, you may want to have a third Paratext 
project set up to receive free translations.</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long 
term goal in mind when creating the Paratext projects and the books for those 
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the Paratext project used for 
source texts&nbsp;ALL books that may eventually be adapted using Adapt It. In 
the Paratext project that is to receive adapted texts, you should 
<strong>create</strong> (or import if they exist) ALL the books that may ever be 
translated now at the beginning of the project. When creating books in the 
Paratext projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but&nbsp;<strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong>             
             
           
             
              
              
    (the Paratext default).</p>
<p>Each line in the list displays a single Paratext project.&nbsp;List lines have up to four parts separated by 
colon characters (:). The first part is the Paratext "Short Name". The second part is 
the Paratext "Full Name" for that project. The third part is the "Language" 
name. The fourth part&nbsp;(if it has been defined within Paratext) is the Ethnologue 
code for that project. Important: If you do not see the 
projects listed that your user will need to use in collaboration, you should STOP at this 
point in the Adapt It setup. Cancel from the Setup Bibledit Collaboration dialog&nbsp;- and do the 
necessary setup of the Paratext projects first. You will not be able to complete 
the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary Paratext projects 
already exist.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> &nbsp;Once you have ensured that 
the necessary Paratext projects have been created, you need to <strong>select at 
least two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong>           
              
    shown in step 2. Click on the first "Select from 
List" button and select the Paratext project from which source texts will be 
obtained during collaboration. Then click on the second "Select from List" 
button and select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;Paratext project which is to receive 
translation drafts during collaboration. If you have set up a third Paratext 
project to receive free translations, use the third button to select that 
project. The Paratext projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of 
the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
"No Free Translation" button.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Adapt It automatically enters any Adapt It project that it knows about 
based on the Language fields specified in the projects selected for obtaining 
source texts and for receiving translation drafts. If Adapt It has been 
used&nbsp;previously for the same languages, it will hook up to the project 
listed in the drop down box during collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used 
previously for the same language pair, it will create a new Adapt It project by 
the name in the drop down box. If no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, 
you may select &lt;Create a new project instead&gt; from the drop down box - in 
which case edit boxes will appear in which you can specify the names to be used 
for the source and target languages that will make up the name of a new Adapt It 
project. When Adapt It works in collaboration with Paratext, it not only 
transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext projects - it also 
maintains its own project in the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" 
folder&nbsp;(or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode version).</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Finally, <strong>click on the radio 
button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong>            
   button. This activates the collaboration&nbsp;between Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Paratext. In a few seconds you should see the&nbsp;following 
main&nbsp;dialog the user will normally see during collaboration:</p>
<p><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width=500 
height=260></p>
<p>From this simple dialog the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for 
collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It will automatically fetch the source 
text and any existing target text from Paratext - merging them if necessary, and 
display them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation 
process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers 
the saved work back to the appropriate Paratext projects.</p>
<p>               
              
As the dialog shows, the user can select to work either 
by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default 
and recommended method of work for collaborating with Paratext. Working by whole book 
is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is 
OK, but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole book.</p>
<p>               
              
Working chapter-by-chapter in Adapt It used to involve a lot of 
work, manually copying and joining files together into whole books and copying 
them back and forth between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Working 
chapter-by-chapter is now done seamlessly as Adapt It knows how to handle all 
the details and keep everything organized behind the scenes - invisible to the 
user. During collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the 
computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Paratext projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to

         you set 
up Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit. Select File &gt; Project &gt; New

list, Adapt It will not make use of&nbsp;the "Language" setting here in the 
Bibledit Project's&nbsp;properties

project to receive free translations, use the third button to select that 
project. The Bibledit projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of 
the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
"No Free Translation" button.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong>         Adapt It automatically enters 
any Adapt It project that it knows about based on the&nbsp;language names 
you entered for the&nbsp;projects selected for obtaining source texts and for receiving 
translation drafts. If Adapt It has been used previously for the same 
languages, it will hook up to the project listed in the drop down box during 
collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used previously for the same language pair, it 
will create a new Adapt It project by the name in the drop down box. If 
no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, you may select &lt;Create a new project 
instead&gt; from the drop down box - in which case edit boxes will appear in which 
you can specify the names to be used for the source and target languages that will make 
up the name of a new Adapt It project. When Adapt It 
works in collaboration with Bibledit, it not only transfers data between Adapt It 
and the selected Bibledit projects - it also maintains its own 
project in the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder.</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Finally, <strong>click on the radio 
button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong>           button. 
This activates the collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit. In 
a few seconds you should see the following main

width=500 height=268>            
          
         
       </p>
<p>From this simple dialog the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for 
collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It will automatically fetch the source 
text and any existing target text from Bibledit - merging them if necessary, and 
display them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation 
process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers 
the saved work back to the appropriate Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>               
              
As the dialog shows, the user can select to work either 
by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default 
and recommended method of work for collaborating with Bibledit. Working by whole book 
is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is 
OK, but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole book.</p>
<p>               
              
Working chapter-by-chapter in Adapt It used to involve a lot of 
work, manually copying and joining files together into whole books and copying 
them back and forth between Adapt It and Bibledit. Not any more! Working 
chapter-by-chapter is now done seamlessly as Adapt It knows how to handle all

computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Bibledit projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>

can also set your own password using the Administrator menu item for that 
purpose. The administrator password is not a highly guarded secret, but exists 
only to hinder inexperienced users from accessing the administrator menu and 
changing settings they should not be changing. If you set your own password it 
will be kept unencrypted in the basic configuration file 
AI-BasicConfiguration.aic located in the Adapt It Unicode Work folder (or Adapt 
It Work folder for the non-Unicode application). If you forget your password, 
you can find it in the AI-BasicConfiguration.aic file, or you can simply use the default 
password mentioned above.</p><br>
<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>What version of Balsa are you using? If you are using 
Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should already have Adapt It 
version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see if there are any recent 
updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x. If you are using Balsa based on Xubuntu 
Lucid, you will want to upgrade the version of Adapt It included there from 
version 5.2.4 to the latest Adapt It version in the 6.x.x. series. In either 
case you will use the Synaptic Package Manager to get the latest version of 
Adapt It. You will need Adapt It version 6.x.x in order to take advantage of its 
new features designed for translation program administrators.</p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
Advisor and Balsa User. You as an administrator need to log in first as Advisor 
to update Adapt It to its latest version 6 which has many new features designed 
to assist you as an administrator. And once you have upgraded Adapt It to 
version 6, you should log off as Advisor and log back in as the Balsa User to 
complete the setup of of Adapt It for that given user. The steps for doing these 
things are listed below:</p>
<p>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt It 
to version 6 if needed</p>
<p>1. Log onto the Advisor account in the Balsa 
system.<br>2. Run the Synaptic Package Manager by selecting it from the 
Applications &gt; System menu. In the Quick search box type the word adaptit. 
The "Installed" version of adaptit listed there should be at least 6.x.x. If the 
package manager doesn't indicate that version 6.x.x is already installed, you 
should go ahead and mark it for installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card 
form of Balsa, you probably will want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation 
(although please note that it is about 11MB of download). After you have ensured 
that Adapt It version 6.x.x is installed, you can close the package manager and 
log off the Advisor Balsa account, and log on to the Balsa User account.</p>
<p>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</p>
