<h1 align="center">Help for Adapt It Administrators</h1>
<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is shown and accessed under password 
control. The Adapt It team highly recommends that you take advantage of the 
Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful setup can make it 
easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and much easier to use 
Adapt It in collaboration with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>

<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with Paratext or Bibledit. Here are the 
steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>1. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext, you should insure that Paratext has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>. These projects should be set up, complete with books 
either imported or created within Paratext BEFORE you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext. Note: The books for the translation drafts and/or 
free translations should exist in the Paratext projects, even though they may be 
empty - with only chapter and verse usfm markers present.</p>
<p>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and Settings"&nbsp; 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table><br>IMPORTANT: From within Paratext's 
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong> dialog you should ensure that 
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly for each project that Adapt 
It will collaborate with. It is the <strong>Language</strong> setting in the 
above dialog where the Paratext language of the "source" and "target" (and "free 
translation") projects are determined within Paratext. Press the 
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a 
unique&nbsp;language name for each project. Therefore, if the 
Paratext&nbsp;project&nbsp;uses <strong>Language A</strong> in the "source" 
project, and <strong>Language B</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;"target texts" 
project,&nbsp;then Adapt It will assume that&nbsp;its own collaboration project 
should be&nbsp;named "<strong>Language A&nbsp;to Language&nbsp;B 
adaptations</strong>". When set up for collaboration, Adapt It will use any 
project that already exists by that name, or if an&nbsp;Adapt It project&nbsp;by 
that name does not already exist,&nbsp;it will create a new one by that name in 
its own work folder ("Adapt It Unicode Work" in the Unicode version, or "Adapt 
It Work" in the non-Unicode version).</p>

<h4>1. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for

<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to

<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>What version of Balsa are you using? If you are using 
Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should already have Adapt It 
version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see if there are any recent 
updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x. If you are using Balsa based on Xubuntu 
Lucid, you will want to upgrade the version of Adapt It included there from 
version 5.2.4 to the latest Adapt It version in the 6.x.x. series. In either 
case you will use the Synaptic Package Manager to get the latest version of 
Adapt It. You will need Adapt It version 6.x.x in order to take advantage of its 
new features designed for translation program administrators.</p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
Advisor and Balsa User. You as an administrator need to log in first as Advisor 
to update Adapt It to its latest version 6 which has many new features designed 
to assist you as an administrator. And once you have upgraded Adapt It to 
version 6, you should log off as Advisor and log back in as the Balsa User to 
complete the setup of of Adapt It for that given user. The steps for doing these 
things are listed below:</p>
<p>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt It 
to version 6 if needed</p>
<p>1. Log onto the Advisor account in the Balsa 
system.<br>2. Run the Synaptic Package Manager by selecting it from the 
Applications &gt; System menu. In the Quick search box type the word adaptit. 
The "Installed" version of adaptit listed there should be at least 6.x.x. If the 
package manager doesn't indicate that version 6.x.x is already installed, you 
should go ahead and mark it for installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card 
form of Balsa, you probably will want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation 
(although please note that it is about 11MB of download). After you have ensured 
that Adapt It version 6.x.x is installed, you can close the package manager and 
log off the Advisor Balsa account, and log on to the Balsa User account.</p>
<p>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</p>
<p>1. Log onto the Balsa User account.<br>2.</p>
