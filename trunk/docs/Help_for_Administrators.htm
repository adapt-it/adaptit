<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is normally hidden from view. It can 
only be shown and accessed under password control. To make the Administrator 
menu visible you can select the <strong>Show Administrator Menu</strong> menu 
item from the View menu. To initially show the Administrator menu you will need 
to use the <a href="#default_password">default password</a>. Once you have 
access to the Administrator menu&nbsp;you can assign a personalized password for 
accessing the Administrator menu, however, the <a 
href="#default_password">default password</a> will always work to make the 
Administrator menu visible at any time.</p>
<p>                  
             
     The Adapt It team highly recommends that you 
take advantage of the Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful 
setup can make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and 
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> .</p>

<h2><a 
name=Automatically_exchange_Scripture_files></a>Automatically exchange Scripture files with Paratext or 
Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a 
href="http://#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="http://#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>            
        . Here are the 
steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>
<h3>1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It (6.1.0) and Paratext (7.1 
or newer) are installed</h3>       
   </h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For Adapt It to collaborate 
with Paratext, you need to <strong>install version 7.1 or 
newer of Paratext and version 6.1.0 or newer of Adapt 
It</strong>. The Windows 
version of Adapt It that is&nbsp;available at&nbsp;<a 
href="http://adapt-it.org">http://adapt-it.org</a>&nbsp;(as of 20 December 2011) 
is new enough. If your version of Adapt It is not at least 6.1.0 or newer, you 
will need to download and install the latest version from <a 
href="http://adapt-it.org">http://adapt-it.org</a>&nbsp;before you can setup Adapt It to automatically exchange 
Scripture files with Paratext.</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext, you should ensure that Paratext has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>. These projects should be set up, complete with books either imported or 
created within Paratext BEFORE you set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext. 
Note: The books for the translation drafts and/or free translations should 
exist in the Paratext projects, even though they may be empty of text&nbsp;- 
such "empty" books should have&nbsp;chapter and verse usfm markers present.</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 419px; HEIGHT: 415px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=419 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/PTNewProject.gif" width=400 height=381></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and Settings"&nbsp; 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table><br>IMPORTANT: From within Paratext's 
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong> dialog you should ensure that 
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly for each project that Adapt 
It will collaborate with. It is the <strong>Language</strong> setting in the 
above dialog where the Paratext language of the "source" and "target" (and "free 
translation") projects are determined within Paratext. Press the 
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a unique&nbsp;language 
name for each project. Therefore, if the 
Paratext&nbsp;project&nbsp;uses&nbsp;<strong>Swahili</strong> in the "source" 
project's Language 
field, and&nbsp; <strong> English</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;"target texts" 
project,&nbsp;then Adapt It will assume that&nbsp;its own collaboration project 
should be&nbsp;named "<strong>  Swahili&nbsp;to&nbsp;English 
adaptations</strong>". When set up for collaboration, Adapt It will use any Adapt 
It project that&nbsp;already exists by that name, or if an&nbsp;Adapt It project&nbsp;by 
that name does not already exist,&nbsp;it will create a new one by that name in 
its own work folder ("Adapt It Unicode Work" in the Unicode version, or "Adapt 
It Work" in the non-Unicode version).</p>
<h3>3. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width=300 height=240>  </p>
<p align="left">When you selecte "Setup Paratext Collaboration..." the following 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 407px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=389 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/SetupPTCollabWithoutLangNamesCtrls.gif" width=500 
      height=350></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up Paratext Collaboration" 
  dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p> <br>You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on 
this dialog:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Before doing any other setup you 
must <strong>verify that the Paratext projects have already been created within 
Paratext</strong>             
     . A minumum of at least two Paratext 
projects are required: One Paratext project for obtaining source texts for 
adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different Paratext project to receive the 
adaptated texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free 
translation in addition to an adaptation, you may want to have a third Paratext 
project set up to receive free translations.</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long 
term goal in mind when creating the Paratext projects and the books for those 
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the Paratext project used for 
source texts&nbsp;ALL books that may eventually be adapted using Adapt It. In 
the Paratext project that is to receive adapted texts, you should 
<strong>create</strong> (or import if they exist) ALL the books that may ever be 
translated now at the beginning of the project. When creating books in the 
Paratext projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but&nbsp;<strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong>             
             
           
             
              
              
    (the Paratext default).</p>
<p>Each line in the list displays a single Paratext project.&nbsp;List lines have up to four parts separated by 
colon characters (:). The first part is the Paratext "Short Name". The second part is 
the Paratext "Full Name" for that project. The third part is the "Language" 
name. The fourth part&nbsp;(if it has been defined within Paratext) is the Ethnologue 
code for that project. Important: If you do not see the 
projects listed that your user will need to use in collaboration, you should STOP at this 
point in the Adapt It setup. Cancel from the Setup Bibledit Collaboration dialog&nbsp;- and do the 
necessary setup of the Paratext projects first. You will not be able to complete 
the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary Paratext projects 
already exist.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> &nbsp;Once you have ensured that 
the necessary Paratext projects have been created, you need to <strong>select at 
least two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong>           
              
    shown in step 2. Click on the first "Select from 
List" button and select the Paratext project from which source texts will be 
obtained during collaboration. Then click on the second "Select from List" 
button and select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;Paratext project which is to receive 
translation drafts during collaboration. If you have set up a third Paratext 
project to receive free translations, use the third button to select that 
project. The Paratext projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of 
the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
"No Free Translation" button.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Adapt It automatically enters any Adapt It project that it knows about 
based on the Language fields specified in the projects selected for obtaining 
source texts and for receiving translation drafts. If Adapt It has been 
used&nbsp;previously for the same languages, it will hook up to the project 
listed in the drop down box during collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used 
previously for the same language pair, it will create a new Adapt It project by 
the name in the drop down box. If no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, 
you may select &lt;Create a new project instead&gt; from the drop down box - in 
which case edit boxes will appear in which you can specify the names to be used 
for the source and target languages that will make up the name of a new Adapt It 
project. When Adapt It works in collaboration with Paratext, it not only 
transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext projects - it also 
maintains its own project in the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" 
folder&nbsp;(or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode version).</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Finally, <strong>click on the radio 
button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong>            
   button. This activates the collaboration&nbsp;between Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Paratext. In a few seconds you should see the&nbsp;following 
main&nbsp;dialog the user will normally see during collaboration:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width=500 
height=259></p>
<p>     From this simple dialog the user can select a 
Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It 
will automatically fetch the source text and any existing target text from Paratext, and 
display them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation 
process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers 
the saved work back to the appropriate Paratext projects.</p>
<p>               
              
As the dialog shows, the user can select to work either 
by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default 
and recommended method of work for collaborating with Paratext. Working by whole book 
is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is 
OK, but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole book.</p>
<p>               
              
Working chapter-by-chapter in Adapt It used to involve a lot of 
work, manually copying and joining files together into whole books and copying 
them back and forth between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Working 
chapter-by-chapter is now done seamlessly as Adapt It knows how to handle all 
the details and keep everything organized behind the scenes - invisible to the 
user. During collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the 
computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Paratext projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>
<h3>4. Adapt It - Paratext collaboration remains in effect until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Paratext if you want to do so by using the same Setup 
Paratext Collaboration dialog and clicking the&nbsp;Collaboration OFF radio 
button. Any documents created while collaboration&nbsp;was ON are still 
available in the Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt It reverts to using its Start Working 
Wizard for selecting projects and documents by name. Adapt It remembers the 
settings you made while collaboration was on, and if you later 
decide to turn collaboration ON again, all that&nbsp;you need to do is to click 
on the Collaboration ON radio button. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The next help topic for Administrators is how to <a

      </p>
<h2><a name="Bibledit_Steps_Start"></a>Bibledit</h2>
<h3>1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It (6.1.0) and Bibledit-Gtk&nbsp;(4.3 
or newer) are installed</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For Adapt It to collaborate 
with Bibledit, you need to <strong>install version 4.3 or newer of Bibledit-gtk and version 6.1.0 or newer of Adapt 
It</strong>.&nbsp;The version of Adapt It that is 
packaged in the SIL repositories (as of 20 December 2011) is new enough. The 
Bibledit that is packaged in the&nbsp;standard Ubuntu repositories (through 
Onerirc), however,&nbsp;is not new enough&nbsp;for handling collaboration 
(typically they have version 4.0 or older).&nbsp;The SIL packages.sil.org repository has a 
version of Bibledit (4.2.67) for Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, 
Natty and Oneiric but that version&nbsp;is not new 
enough to support collaboration with Adapt It.&nbsp;Until the official Ubuntu repositories 
get a newer version of Bibledit, the Bibledit team has made 
newer versions of Bibledit available in the CrossWire repository. 
Therefore, in order to be able to get Adapt It and Bibledit to 
collaborate together,&nbsp;you will need to ensure that your Software 
Sources have the necessary repositories listed in their "Other Software" settings. Do the 
following steps:</p>
<p>a. Start up&nbsp;<strong>Synaptic Package Manager. 
</strong>         
          It 
should be located in the System&nbsp;&gt; Administration menu (If it is 
not there or you are using Unity which doesn't install it by 
default,&nbsp;you can find&nbsp;the Synaptic Package Manager by clicking on "Ubuntu Software Center".&nbsp;In 
the Ubuntu Software Center's Search box type "Synaptic", then click on the "Synaptic 
Package Manager" item when it appears and click on 
"Install").</p>
<p>b. In the Synaptic Package Manager application click on 
the <strong>Settings &gt; Repositories</strong>. Click on the "<strong>Other 
Software</strong>" tab. Examine the list of software repositories. If there is 
not already a line that contains a reference to 
<strong>http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;...</strong>, then click on the 
"Add..." button at the bottom. Then enter <strong>one</strong>         
               
           
    of the following lines depending on which distribution of 
Ubuntu Linux is installed on your machine:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu lucid main<br>deb 
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu maverick main<br>deb 
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu&nbsp;natty main<br>deb 
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu oneiric main</strong></font> 
  </p>
<p>c. Close the Software Sources, and back in Synaptic 
Package Manager, click on "Reload" to insure you have the latest information from the repositories. 
If you get an error, check that you have entered the correct line 
into your Other Software (step b above).</p>
<p>d. Click on the "Search" button and type 
<strong>adaptit</strong> in the search box. When the&nbsp;adaptit packages 
appear, look&nbsp;at the "Installed Version" and "Latest Version" columns. 
Ensure that the version listed for adaptit is <strong>at least 6.1.0</strong>. 
If the "Latest Version" (if no version of adaptit is at least 6.1.0 make sure 
you have set up the http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu line correctly in the 
Synaptic Package Manager's Software Sources setup in step b above). If no 
version is listed in the "Installed Version", or if the "Latest Version" is 
newer than&nbsp;the "Installed Version" listed you should mark the adaptit is entries for installation or 
upgrade. To mark the adaptit and adaptit-docs packages, right click on them 
and select "Mark for Installation" or "Mark for Upgrade" from the popup menu. 
Select the "Mark" button in the warning dialog. Then 
click on the "Apply" button at the top of the Synaptic Package Manager 
application, and click on the "Apply" button on the Summary dialog. Close Synaptic 
Package Manager after it completes the installation of 
Adapt It.</p>
<p>e. Close the Synaptic Package Manager and open a 
Terminal. In the terminal type the following&nbsp;commands (respond with 'y' and 
Enter to have it continue if it asks "Install these 
packages without verification?").</p>
<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>sudo add-apt-repository 
ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa<br>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 
--recv-keys DF7691D7</strong><br><strong>sudo apt-get update<br>sudo apt-get 
install bibledit-gtk</strong></font> 
  </p>
<p>After their installation, both Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Bibledit-Gtk should be listed in the Office menu (or can be found by 
searching for adaptit or bibledit on Unity's DeskHome search bar). The next step 
is to ensure that you have your Bibledit projects (at least two) setup 
within Bibledit.</p>
<h3>2. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Bibledit, you should ensure that Bibledit has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Bibledit for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong> . These projects should be set up, complete with books 
either imported or created within Bibledit <strong>BEFORE</strong>          
             
         you set 
up Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit. Select File &gt; Project &gt; New 
to access Bibledit's "Project properites" dialog. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 412px; HEIGHT: 352px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=412 align=center>
  
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Bibledit "Project properties" 
dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p align="left">Note: You can ignore the Language setting 
field shown above during the setup for collaboration. If you know how to set up 
a customized Bibledit language name you can do so, but because of the difficulty 
for most users in setting up a custom language for the above Language drop down 
list, Adapt It will not make use of&nbsp;the "Language" setting here in the 
Bibledit Project's&nbsp;properties 
dialog. Instead Adapt It&nbsp;will ask you in step 2 below for the 
language names it will use&nbsp;for the Bibledit projects participating in&nbsp;the collaboration process.</p>
<h3>3. Set Up Adapt It - Bibledit Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupBECollab.gif" width=300 height=240>       </p>
<p align="left">When you selecte "Setup Bibledit Collaboration..." the following

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up&nbsp;Bibledit Collaboration" 
  dialog</p></td></tr></table>  </p>
<p> <br>You should follow the 4 
numbered steps as shown on this dialog:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Before doing any other setup you 
must <strong>verify that the Bibledit projects have already been created within 
Bibledit</strong>             
     . A minumum of at least two Bibledit 
projects are required: One Bibledit project for obtaining source texts for 
adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different Bibledit project to receive the 
adaptated texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free 
translation in addition to an adaptation, you may want to have a third Bibledit

    (the Bibledit default).</p>
<p>           
               
   Each line in the list displays a single Bibledit project. 
Whatever you assign as "Name" in the Bibledit project properties will be shown 
in the above dialog. Important: If you do not see the

Bibledit project from which source texts will be obtained during collaboration. Adapt 
It will then display this dialog asking you for the name 
of the source language:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0"

        Enter the language name 
of the source language of the project you just selected to obtain 
source texts. Then click on the second "Select from List" button and select a 
different Bibledit project which is to receive translation drafts during collaboration. Adapt 
It will then display another dialog asking you for the name 
of the target language:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Enter_tgt_lang_name_dlgBE.gif" width=300 height=102>           
              
              
             
           
         
            
            
              
            
           
   </p>
<p align="left">           
              
              
             
      Enter the language name of 
the target language of the project you just selected 
to receive translation drafts. If you have set up a third Bibledit 
project to receive free translations, use the third button to select that 
project. The Bibledit projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of 
the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
"No Free Translation" button.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong>         Adapt It automatically enters 
any Adapt It project that it knows about based on the&nbsp;language names 
you entered for the&nbsp;projects selected for obtaining source texts and for receiving 
translation drafts. If Adapt It has been used previously for the same 
languages, it will hook up to the project listed in the drop down box during 
collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used previously for the same language pair, it 
will create a new Adapt It project by the name in the drop down box. If 
no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, you may select &lt;Create a new project 
instead&gt; from the drop down box - in which case edit boxes will appear in which 
you can specify the names to be used for the source and target languages that will make 
up the name of a new Adapt It project. When Adapt It 
works in collaboration with Bibledit, it not only transfers data between Adapt It 
and the selected Bibledit projects - it also maintains its own 
project in the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder.</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Finally, <strong>click on the radio 
button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong>           button. 
This activates the collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit. In 
a few seconds you should see the following main 
dialog the user will normally see during collaboration:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" 
width=500 height=268>            
          
         
       </p>
<p>From this simple dialog the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for 
collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It will automatically fetch the source 
text and any existing target text from Bibledit - merging them if necessary, and 
display them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation 
process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers 
the saved work back to the appropriate Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>               
              
As the dialog shows, the user can select to work either 
by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default 
and recommended method of work for collaborating with Bibledit. Working by whole book 
is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is 
OK, but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole book.</p>
<p>               
              
Working chapter-by-chapter in Adapt It used to involve a lot of 
work, manually copying and joining files together into whole books and copying 
them back and forth between Adapt It and Bibledit. Not any more! Working 
chapter-by-chapter is now done seamlessly as Adapt It knows how to handle all 
the details and keep everything organized behind the scenes - invisible to the 
user. During collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the 
computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Bibledit projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>
<h3>4. Adapt It - Bibledit collaboration remains in effect until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Bibledit if you want to do so by using the same Setup 
Bibledit Collaboration dialog and clicking the Collaboration OFF radio button. 
Any documents created while collaboration was ON are still available in the 
Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt It reverts to using its Start Working 
Wizard for selecting projects and documents by name. Adapt It remembers the 
settings you made while collaboration was on, and if you later 
decide to turn collaboration ON again, all that you need to do is to 
click on the Collaboration ON radio button.</p>

<h2><a name="Setup_User_Workflow_Profile"></a>    Set up a 
User Workflow Profile</h2>
<p>Adapt It has many menu items and features to choose 
from. Such choices may be bewildering to a new user or inexperienced user. Adapt 
It now allows an administrator to control which choices appear in the program's 
interface, and which others remain hidden until such time as they may be needed. 
To activate a user workflow profile, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the&nbsp;Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select User Workflow Profiles... menu item.&nbsp;The following 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/User_workflow_profiles.gif" width=400 height=429>       
  </p>
<p>This dialog organizes Adapt It's menu selections, 
Preferences tabs, Mode bar items, and&nbsp;Tool bar items into four lists or 
"profiles"&nbsp;that correspond&nbsp;to the four tabs at the top of the dialog. 
Those tabs or profiles are labeled "Novice", "Experienced", "Skilled" and 
"Custom." The list in each tab all contain the same list of items, but we've 
preselected certain items on each list that we think should be visible for that 
profile, and un-selected those items that we think would be good to remain 
hidden for the given profile. The Novice profile starts with most of the listed 
items hidden (un-ticked). The Experienced profile makes a few more items visible 
in the interface (by ticking&nbsp;more items). The Skilled profile makes many 
more interface items visible (by ticking even more items).</p>
<p>Our suggestions are only a starting point; each profile 
can be further customized by you, the administrator, to your liking and 
according to your knowledge of the skills and needs of the user. If you select 
the fourth tab labeled "Custom" Adapt It will ask you if you want to initialize 
the selections from one of the other three profiles as a starting point 
-&nbsp;from which you may continue to customize which interface items are to be 
shown (ticked), and which should be hidden (un-ticked).</p>
<p>The default profile&nbsp;setting is 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menus and settings visible)". If you want to 
use a workflow profile, you first need to click the radio button labeled, 
"<strong>Use a workflow profile</strong> (select from drop down list below)". 
This selection enables the drop down box located below it. Only one profile can 
be selected at a given time for the user. You can select the desired profile by 
using the drop down box which will allow you&nbsp;to select the Novice, 
Experienced, Skilled or the Custom profile. Then, to make the interface start 
using a selected profile click on the "Save Changes" button.</p>
<p>At any time you can come back to the User Workflow 
Profiles dialog and switch to a different profile or adjust the individual items 
that should be visible or hidden for a given profile, and save the changes.</p>
<p>If you modified the items in a given profile, and now 
want to revert&nbsp;that profile to its "factory defaults" you can do so by 
first selecting that profile in the drop down box, and then clicking on&nbsp;the 
"Revert to factory defaults" button. If the "Revert to factory defaults" button 
is disabled, it means that you have not changed the viewing status of any 
individual item in that profile's list.</p>
<p>To stop using&nbsp;a user profile, simply click on the 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menu and settings visible)" radio button. Adapt 
It will remember your settings in case you later decide to re-activate a 
workflow profile that you set up previously.</p>
<p>The next help topic for Administrators is how to<a 
  href="#Pre-Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">Pre-Assign locations for the 
  various kinds of inputs and outputs</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a 
name=Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs></a>Pre-Assign locations for the various kinds of 
inputs and outputs</h2>
<p>Some computer users find it difficult or confusing to 
navigate through a hierarchical file system. They often are not sure where the 
files are located that they need to open, or where to save or export files from 
Adapt It. They may get lost navigating around the file system inside a file 
browser. They may not really know what a file would be called that they are 
looking for, nor what a file should be called when saving or exporting data from 
Adapt It. Adapt It 6 now allows you the administrator to pre-assign locations 
for any and all the kinds of inputs and outputs that can be done by a user. We 
call this a way to "protect" a user from having to do any navigation of the file system in order to get 
his work done.</p>
<p>Adapt It now allows you the administrator, to pre-assign 
locations for Adapt It's inputs and outputs, and therefore protect the user from 
having to compose file names and from having to navigate the file system to find 
or save files. To activate these protections, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select the "Assign Locations for Inputs and 
Outputs..." menu item.</p>
<p>If you plan to setup Adapt It to collaborate with 
Paratext or Bibledit you should do that setup step before assigning locations 
for inputs and outputs. If you have Paratext (or Bibledit) installed on the 
user's computer and collaboration has not yet been set up, Adapt It will display the following reminder before the 
main dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Reminder_to_setup_PT_first_before_assigning_locations.gif" 
width=400 height=148>       
  </p>
<p>After clicking OK, the main dialog appears, which 
looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_dlg_nothing_ticked.gif" width=500 
height=292>       
  </p>
<p>By default none of the "Protect from Navigation" check 
boxes are ticked. Each of the names in upper case letters and starting 
with&nbsp;one or two&nbsp;initial _ underscore characters, are the names of a 
standard set of folders that Adapt It 6 will automatically create on the user's 
computer. These folder locations will become the default location for the types 
of data described by the folder's names. If you as administrator, wish to 
"protect" that type of data, you can simply put a tick by as many folder 
locations as you want. If you want to protect all the types of data that Adapt 
It uses or exports, simply click on the "Protect All (Check 
All Boxes)" button.</p>
<p>A setup for a fully protected user (with Paratext collaboration turned ON) would 
look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs_all_checked.gif" 
width=500 height=292>       
  </p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It is working in collaboration with 
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically limits the location&nbsp;for 
the&nbsp;source text inputs it obtains for adaptation work, and it also limits 
the locations where translation drafts are exported - to the Paratext or 
Bibledit projects that are assigned during collaboration.&nbsp; Therefore, if 
you have previously set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, 
the "Protext from Navigation" check boxes to the right of __SOURCE_INPUTS and 
_TARGET_OUTPUTS will indicate (as shown in the dialog immediately 
above)&nbsp;that they are "Using Paratext project"; they will be automatically ticked and 
cannot be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, please understand that if Adapt It is 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, SOURCE texts can only be obtained from 
the Paratext or Bibledit projects - and Adapt It's TARGET texts (adapted 
translation drafts) will always be transferred automatically back to Paratext 
or Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>However, if your user will <strong>not</strong> be 
collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, you should consider at least selecting 
the "Protect from Navigation" for the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder. When this folder 
is "protected" the user will only see and be able to select from a list of input 
texts for adaptation that are located in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder. This can be 
a very helpful way to guide the user in what texts to use for adaptation. 
<strong>Since the user cannot obtain source text from anywhere else it is 
important that you, the advisor, pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder with the 
input texts that the user will need for his or her adaptation work</strong>. A 
convenient way to pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder, it to use the "<a 
href="#Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders">Move or Copy Files Or Folders</a>" 
dialog from the Administrator menu. This dialog is designed like a "smart" file 
browser and knows what kind of files can be used 
for adaptation work.</p>
<p>When a folder location has "Protect from Navigation" 
activated, Adapt It will not ask the user for a file name nor allow the user to 
navigate to a different folder, but will automatically assign a file name to the 
input or output file, and read it from or store it to 
the indicated location.</p>
<p>When navigation protection is activated for a given 
input/output type, Adapt It automatically assigns names to files, it composes the 
name based on the type of the file's contents and adds a date-time "stamp" at 
the end of the name, and affixes the appropriate extension. This results in some 
long file names, but that is of no concern to the user, because when "Protect 
from Navigation" is activated the user doesn't have to interact with files or 
file names anyway. For example, the automatically composed name for an RTF 
export of the target text might look 
something like this:</p><strong>_Target_Text_45_ACT_CH02_exported_2011_07_11T14_25_53Z.rtf</strong>
<p>and it would be located in the 
<strong>_TARGET_RTF_OUTPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project. Because of 
the presence of the date-time stamp within the file name, there is never going 
to be a danger of files overwriting one another because all exported files will 
have unique, easily discernable&nbsp;names, and files with similar content will sort together 
in chronological order.</p>
<p>Note: The assignment of text type prefixes and/or date-time stamp suffixes on 
file names is not automatically done when navigation protection is OFF for a 
given input/output type, but it text type prefixes and date-time stamp suffixes 
can be used if desired at import/export time by ticking the appropriate check 
boxes on the dialog that appears.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the Assign Locations For Inputs 
and Outputs dialog to help keep your user's data organized into predictable 
locations and its files consistently named - so that they are easily identified as to 
content and&nbsp;creation date.</p>
<p>When Adapt It is setup for collaboration with Paratext 
or Bibledit, Adapt It keeps a copy of each chapter or book file that it obtains 
from Paratext/Bibledit - placing the copy in the 
<strong>__SOURCE_INPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project that is hooked 
up to Paratext/Bibledit during collaboration. The files that Adapt It puts in 
the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder are named automatically by Adapt It, and will have a 
_Collab_ prefix on the name.&nbsp;A chapter file for chapter 2 of the book of 
Matthew obtained from Paratex or Bibledit will be named similar to 
the following example:</p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.txt</strong>
<p>If collaboration is done by&nbsp;whole book, a&nbsp;file 
obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to 
the following example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.txt</strong>       
  </p>
<p>The adaptation documents that Adapt It creates - 
regardless of whether collaboration is ON or OFF, are still stored in the 
"<strong>Adaptations</strong>" folder of the Adapt It project. When 
collaboration is turned ON, those files are automatically named by Adapt It. The adaptation document for Matthew chapter 2 
would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.xml</strong>       
  </p>
<p>and the adaptation document for the whole book of Matthew 
would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.xml</strong>       
  </p>
<p>in either case these xml formatted adaptation 
documents&nbsp;are always&nbsp;located in the <strong>Adaptations</strong>    folder of the 
Adapt It project.</p>

<h2><a name="Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders"></a>    Moving or copying 
files or folders.</h2>
<p>As an administrator you may have a need to move or copy 
files from within Adapt It. Adapt It 6 provides an "intelligent" file browser 
for administrative use. To get Adapt It's file browser, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select the "Move Or Copy Folders Or Files..." menu item. When you do so the following dual 
pane dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Move_or_Copy_Folders_or_Files.gif" width=500 
height=311>       
  </p>
<p>Note that generally, if your users are going to be 
working&nbsp;with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, you 
probably do not need to worry about moving or copying files or folders for Adapt 
It's use. In collaboration work the main data you will be concerned about will 
be the data kept in the Paratext or Bibledit data store. In collaboration mode 
Adapt It becomes an adaptation engine for Paratext or Bibledit, and the 
scripture data essentially stays within the Paratext or Bibledit projects. Adapt 
It automatically&nbsp;makes copies of the data and creates its own project for 
the purposes of adaptation, and Adapt It automatically transfers its target 
texts (translation drafts) back to Paratext or Bibledit. Hence, all data is 
destined to start and end within the 
designated Paratext/Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>The above "intelligent" file browser can be helpful if 
you do not plan to work with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or 
Bibledit. In such cases, you can use this dialog to copy potential source texts into an Adapt It 
project's __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.</p>

<h2><a

an administrator password</h2>
<p>To access the Administrator menu you first need to make 
the Administrator menu visible. From within Adapt It click on the "Show 
Administrator Menu..." item on the View menu. For the password, you can always 
enter the <a name="default_password"></a>default password which is the word admin. 
You can also set your own password using the Administrator menu item for that 
purpose. The administrator password is not a highly guarded secret, but exists 
only to hinder inexperienced users from accessing the administrator menu and 
changing settings they should not be changing. If you set your own password it 
will be kept unencrypted in the basic configuration file 
AI-BasicConfiguration.aic located in the Adapt It Unicode Work folder (or Adapt 
It Work folder for the non-Unicode application). If you forget your password, 
you can find it in the AI-BasicConfiguration.aic file, or you can simply use the default 
password mentioned above.</p>

<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>           
             
               
        What version of Balsa are you 
using? If you are using Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should 
already have Adapt It version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see 
if there are any recent updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x at the&nbsp;packages.sil.org repository. 
When the Lucid version of Balsa boots up, and you log on to the Balsa User 
account, the opening screen looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/BalsaOpeningScreen.gif" width=500 height=293>           
             
               
              
              
              
              
                
      </p>
<p>           
             
               
              
         The Lucid version of Balsa 
as shown above has Adapt It version 5.2.4. You will need Adapt It version 
6.x.x in order to take advantage of its new features designed for assisting translation 
program administrators, and especially working in collaboration with the Balsa Scripture editor Bibledit. The icon for 
Adapt It version 6 looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/ai_new_icon.gif" width=107 height=118> <br><font 
face=Arial><strong>Adapt It</strong></font>           
             
               
              
              
              
              
                
      </p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
<strong>Advisor</strong> and <strong>Balsa User</strong>. <strong>You as an administrator need to log in first as 
Advisor</strong>    
        to update Adapt It to its latest 
version 6 update which has many new features designed to assist you as an 
administrator. Then, once you have upgraded Adapt It to version 6, you should 
<strong>log off as Advisor</strong> and <strong>log back in as the</strong> 
<strong>Balsa User</strong>          
               
               
              
  to complete the setup of Adapt It for that given user. Except for upgrading Adapt 
It to the latest version 6.x.x, all remaining setup of Adapt It should be done using 
the Balsa User account.</p>
<p><strong>Note: any data you create while logged into the Advisor account in 
Balsa will NOT appear within Adapt It when Balsa is logged into the Balsa User 
account, and likewise any data&nbsp;the user&nbsp;creates within Adapt It under 
the Balsa User account will not appear when logged into the Advisor 
account.</strong></p>
<p>The steps for doing these things are listed below:</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt It 
to version 6 (if needed)</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Advisor</strong>     account in the Balsa 
system.<br>2. Run the <strong>Synaptic Package 
Manager</strong> by selecting it from the Applications &gt; System menu. In the 
Quick search box type the word adaptit. The "Installed" version of adaptit 
listed there should be at least 6.0.0. If the package manager doesn't indicate 
that version 6.x.x is already installed, you should go ahead and mark it for 
installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card form of Balsa, you probably will 
want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation (although please note 
that&nbsp;the adaptit-docs package&nbsp;is about 11MB of download). <br>3. After 
you have ensured that Adapt It version 6.x.x is installed, you can close the 
package manager and <strong>log off the Advisor Balsa account</strong>           
             
              
           
                
             
              
             . 
Next you will need to log on to the Balsa User account (see below).</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Balsa User</strong>      account.<br>2. On the "Work" desktop double click on the <strong>Adapt 
It icon</strong> to start up Adapt It.<br>3. Set up the necessary Bibledit 
projects for collaboration. You will need at least two Bibledit projects: One 
for obtaining source texts, and one for receiving translation (target text) 
drafts.<br>4. Access Adapt It's <strong>Administrator menu</strong> (see how to 
access the Administrator menu <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">here</a>).<br>5. After creating the 
Bibledit projects (step 3), set up Adapt it to collaborate with Bibledit (follow 
the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> section of this document for 
detailed steps).<br>6. Assign locations for inputs and outputs using the dialog 
for that purpose. It is recommended that you tick all of the "Protect from 
Navigation" check boxes. See <a 
href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">this section</a>&nbsp;for 
details.</p>

<h2><a name="Setup_custom_work_folder"></a>  Set up 
a custom work folder (Optional)</h2>
<p>For most users you should just allow Adapt It to create 
and maintain its default "Adapt It Unicode Work" folder (or "Adapt It Work" for 
the non-Unicode version) in the default location. For Windows systems, Adapt It 
will by default create this folder in the user's "Documents" (or "My Documents") 
folder. For Linux systems this work folder will be created in the 
/home/&lt;user&gt; folder. On Mac systems this folder will be created in the 
/Users/&lt;user&gt; folder.</p>
<p>In some cases you may want Adapt It to use a custom work 
folder in a non-default location - such as on a different disk partition, or in 
a different folder than the default location. You can use the Administrator 
menu's "Custom Work Folder..." item to assign the location where Adapt It will 
establish its work folder. When you select "Custom Work Folder", Adapt It will 
display a standard dialog in which you can navigate to the location where you 
want Adapt It to establish its work folder.</p>
<p>Adapt It will remember&nbsp;any custom work 
folder&nbsp;location that you specify -&nbsp;until such time as you, the 
administrator specify a different location or choose "Restore Default Work 
Folder Location" from the Administrator menu. If you establish a custom work 
folder location Adapt It will offer to lock it in that location. If you choose 
not to lock it in that location, Adapt It will only continue using that location 
for the current work session.</p>

<h3>        
Preparations for Collaboration Work (with Paratext or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>* <strong>Prepare the Paratext/Bibledit 
projects.</strong> You as Administrator should prepare the Paratext/Bibledit 
projects <strong>BEFORE</strong>        
  setting up Adapt It collaboration. You should make sure that <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> has <strong>at least TWO 
projects</strong>        
             
          
            
             
          
             
           
          
          
                  
       :</p>
<p>1. A project that contains the source language texts from which Adapt It will 
obtain its source texts for adaptation work. Preferably this Paratext/Bibledit 
project should contain all the available source texts that will be used in 
collaboration. </p>
<p>2. You also should make sure that Paratext or Bibledit has a 
<strong>different</strong> project created which will receive the adapted 
translation drafts produced by Adapt It. </p>
<p>If your user will be preparing free translations, you should also create a 
third project in Paratext/Bibledit to receive free translations. The books you 
create in the Paratext/Bibledit projects for receiving the target text&nbsp;and 
free translations can be empty but they&nbsp;should be created with (empty) 
chapter and verse numbers. Ensure that the (empty) books created correspond to 
the books that exist in the source language project.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup Paratext/Bibledit 
Collaboration.</strong> You as Administrator should setup collaboration using 
the "Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration..." menu item on the Adapt It 
Administrator menu.&nbsp;Using that Adapt It dialog, designate the 
Paratext/Bibledit project that are to be used, and turn ON collaboration. This 
ensures that the user will not have to do any setup, but can simply start 
working by choosomg the book and chapter to work on. After enabling 
collaboration, you should ensure that things are working correctly by selecting 
a scripture book and a chapter from the "Get Source Text from Paratext/Bibledit 
Project dialog". If you get any errors, see the <a 
href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration">Trouble Shooting</a>        
          
        
            
                 
       topic.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup a user workflow profile.</strong> You as 
Administrator should carefully consider the skill and experience of&nbsp;the 
user, and determine if one of Adapt It's pre-configured <a 
href="#Setup_User_Workflow_Profile">user workflow profiles</a> would be 
appropriate&nbsp;for&nbsp;a given&nbsp;user. You can establish a user profile 
using the Administrator menu's "User Workflow Profiles..." menu item. The 
<strong>Novice</strong> user profile hides most menu items and options that are 
not absolutely necessary for basic adaptation work. The 
<strong>Experienced</strong> and <strong>Skilled</strong> profiles enable more 
menu items and interface options. You can also customize any of the profiles or 
design your own profile using the <strong>Custom</strong> user profile. If you 
decide to use a profile, you should practice using Adapt It yourself with that 
profile in force, or at least closely watch the user working with that user 
profile in effect, to make sure that the options that remain visible&nbsp;are 
suitable for the skills and the work expected of that user. You don't want to hide options that a 
user really will need to do his job.</p>
<p>* <strong>Assign Locations for Inputs and 
Outputs.</strong> During collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It 
automatically limits the locations for source text inputs and target text 
outputs to the Paratext or Bibledit project being used in collaboration. But, 
Adapt It is able to do other kinds of inputs and exports. You as Administrator, 
should decide whether your user should be "protected" from the possibility of 
getting inputs from the wrong place, and exporting outputs to the wrong place. 
Without such protection files can get lost or misplaced. We suggest that 
you&nbsp;select all of the "Protect from Navigation" check boxes in the "<a 
href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">Assign Locations for Inputs and 
Outputs</a>" dialog. When the "Protect from Navigation" check box is ticked, 
Adapt It will automatically name and locate files for that particular type of input or output, 
placing the files within Adapt It's special folders.</p>
<p>* <strong>Check the settings in Adapt It's Preferences 
dialog.</strong> The Preferences dialog is accessible from the Edit menu with a 
document loaded for collaboration. You as Administrator should ensure that Adapt 
It is using&nbsp;the correct <strong>Fonts</strong>, 
<strong>Punctuation</strong>, and any <strong>Case 
equivalences</strong>&nbsp;for the languages involved in the collaboration work. Use the tabs in 
the Preferences dialog to make any needed changes.</p>
<h3>       Training 
points for Collaboration Work (with Paratext or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>Once you have done the necessary preparations as 
described in the "Preparations for Collaboration Work" section above, you should 
provide some supervised training in the use of 
Adapt It. Your training should include the following:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;<strong>Supervised "hands-on" adaptation work 
with the actual texts of the collaboration project.</strong> There is a document 
supplied with Adapt It installations called "Adapt It Tutorial.doc". Chapter 1 
of that Tutorial contains information that is focused on situations 
where&nbsp;Adapt It is set up to work with texts apart from collaboration 
scenarios. It covers information that you as administrator might find helpful, 
but the user will not need to understand to work in collaboration with Paratext 
or Bibledit. However, chapter 2&nbsp;of the Adapt It Tutorial.doc is called 
"Working on a document", and contains good information and exercises. You will 
want to adapt the&nbsp;information and&nbsp;procedures demonstrated there to 
your actual collaboration texts. Hence, you should help the user practice using 
actual texts in the collaboration project&nbsp;until s/he feels comfortable 
working with Adapt It. The knowledge and adaptation skills that treated in the tutorial and that 
are important for the user to develop are:</p>
<p>1. Understanding the parts of Adapt It's main window 
(menus, toolbar, modebar, layout of strips, piles).<br>2. Positioning the phrase 
box, typing text into it, pressing Enter to advance it.<br>3. Merging source 
words to make a source phrase.<br>4. Unmerging a source phrase.<br>5. Accepting 
a default adaptation without changes.<br>6. Retranslating a section of source 
text; removing or editing a retranslation.<br>7. Inserting an extra word or 
phrase; removing inserted words or phrases.<br>8. Reading your translation 
without the source text being shown.<br>9. Single-step mode versus Automatic 
mode.<br>10. When there are multiple translations - the Choose Translation 
dialog.<br>     11. Leaving a 
source word untranslated - three kinds of "nothing".</p>
<p> There is also a more comprehensive "Adapt 
It Reference.doc" document which you may find helpful.</p>
<p>* <strong>Getting texts by "Chapter Only"</strong> is 
the default method of exchanging texts with Paratext or Bibledit. However a user 
may also select "Get Whole Book"&nbsp;-&nbsp;as is 
shown in the main user dialog during collaboration:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" 
width=500 height=268>        
       </p>
<p>Users can select to "Get Chapter Only" or "Get Whole 
Book". We recommend that users be trained to leave the default set as "Get 
Chapter Only" - at least as long as they are adapting one of the larger 
books.&nbsp;Single chapter chunks load and save more quickly than whole books 
such as the Gospels and Acts. Since Adapt It organizes everything and 
automatically does all transfers between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit, 
there is no logistical&nbsp;problem for the user to work chapter by chapter. In 
any case, the user should not change between collaborating by Chapter Only and 
Whole Book for a given book. If adapting chapter-by-chapter, the user should continue 
working chapter-by-chapter until the whole book is finished.</p>
<p>* <strong>Reporting Problems and Giving 
Feedback</strong>. Adapt It is provided free of charge under an open 
source license. The developers are quick to respond to email reports of problems 
and requests. They depend on the reports of any problems as well as feedback 
from field users to improve Adapt It. Before reporting problems to the 
developers, please have a look at the <a 
href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration">Trouble Shooting</a> topic below. If that 
does not help you resolve the problem, feel free to contact the developers either via email or via the "Report a Problem..." 
selection in Adapt It's help menu (see below).</p>
<p>            
             
              
      Adapt It version 6 now has an easy to use email 
reporting feature - located on the Adapt It Help menu. Just click on the Help 
menu item labeled "<strong>Report a Problem...</strong>" and Adapt It will display the following dialog - 
with much of the information already filled in:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Report_a_problemDlg.gif" width=400 height=396>        
       </p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and a brief description of the steps to reproduce the 
problem, using the text in the edit box as a guide for your comments. If a document is open that illustrates the 
problem, just click on the "Attach the document (packed)" button to include a 
copy of the packed document along with the report. If you have access to the Internet, 
you can click on the "Send Now" button to send your report. Adapt 
It also saves a copy of your report in the _LOGS_EMAIL_REPORTS folder located 
in its "Adapt It (Unicode) Work" folder. The usage log is automatically included in the email 
report (unless you untick the check box). It would likely provide information and possible error messages 
that would help us understand the cause of any problem.</p>
<p>There is also a Help menu item called "<strong>Give 
Feedback...</strong>". The form looks similar to the form for reporting a 
problem, but is provided to make giving feedback easier to do via email:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Give_Feedback.gif" width=400 height=396></p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email 
subject/summary, your name and your feedback in the edit box provided. Use the 
text in the box as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: Adapt It sends all such emails to the developers 
using secured SSL encryption directly from the Adapt It program, so email 
communications are done safely. The user's computer does not have to have an 
email client installed to send these reports.</p>

            Adapt 
It relies on a separate utility program that it uses to 
exchange data between Adapt It and Paratext. Adapt It 
installs a utility program called <strong>rdwrtp7.exe</strong> that it 
attempts to execute 
when collaborating with Paratext on Windows systems. Ordinarily you need not worry 
about these utility programs. However, we have not been able to test these utility 
programs on all possible computer system configurations and architectures. 
So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Paratext, it is lilkely that the 
problem could be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to 
account for between your computer system and the version of the utility program 
installed by Adapt

      Paratext, and          
            
             
      you have upgraded to the newer version, 
you should insure that Adapt It can still collaborate with the newer&nbsp;version of 
Paratext. If you encounter a problem with Adapt It - Paratext 
collaboration after updating your Paratext installation, please let us know so 
we can provide an Adapt It update that will correct the problem. Such problems 
are not very likely to happen between Adapt It and Paratext, but if they do 
happen it is most likely they would happen after a fairly major update of either 
Paratext or Adapt It. Please write down the text of any error messages that 
appear, and include those with any reports problem reports you send us. If you 
have Internet acces you can try submitting a report directly from Adapt It (see 
the "Report a Problem..." selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a 
report via regular email (our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About

<h3>Problems in          
            
             
    Collaboration with Bibledit</h3>
<p>Note: Most problems in collaboration between Adapt It 
and Bibledit can be solved by ensuring that your version of Adapt It is at least 
version 6.1.0 and your version of Bibledit is at least 4.3. See the <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Step 1 of the Bibledit setup process</a>. If you 
have done all the setup steps for Bibledit, but are still having problems, the

      Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it 
uses to exchange data between Adapt It and Bibledit. There are 
different utility programs for different computer architectures (32-bit, 
64-bit, etc) and Ubuntu distributions. Adapt It installs a utility program 
called <strong>adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong> for collaboration with Bibledit 
on Linux systems. Ordinarily you need not worry about these utility programs. 
However, we have not been able to test these utility programs on all possible 
computer system configurations, and especially on different Linux distributions/architectures. 
So, if you get errors when attempting to setup 
collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit, it is lilkely that the 
problem could be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to 
account for between your computer system and the version of the utility program 
installed by Adapt          
            
             
      It.</p>
<p>          
            
             
      The Bibledit development team has provided an official 
collaboration utility (called bibledit-rdwrt) that became available in Bibledit 
version 4.2.93 or newer.          
            
             
      Until a bibledit-gtk version of Bibledit becomes readily 
available in the Ubuntu distributions that is <strong>at least version 
4.2.93</strong> or later (which comes with its own bibledit-rdwrt 
utility),&nbsp;users may encounter&nbsp;situations where Adapt It's version of 
the utility (called adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt to distinguish it from the one to be 
supplied by future version of Bibledit) is not compatible with the&nbsp;user's 
system configuration - i.e., needs a version of a Linux dynamic library that is 
not&nbsp;available or is incorrect, for example.&nbsp;If&nbsp;an error in Adapt 
It for Linux appears like          
            
             
      this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/CollabErrorLinux2.gif" width=455 height=231>          
            
             
      </p>
<p>it means that Adapt It has located the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility but it cannot execute 
the&nbsp;utility program. This error indicates that the permissions 
are not correctly assigned to the utility program at the location indicated 
in the error message.&nbsp;You should be able to resolve this issue 
by changing the utility program's permissions by typing the following command 
from within a Linux terminal          
            
             
      session:</p>
<p><font face="Courier"><strong>sudo chmod a+x 
/usr/local/bin/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong></font>          
            
             
      </p>
<p>          
            
             
      and that should correct the          
            
             
      error.</p>
<p>          
            
             
      If an error in Adapt It for Linux appears like          
            
             
      this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/CollabErrorLinux1.gif" width=474 height=248>          
            
             
      </p>
<p>          
            
             
                
       
           
             
            
           
            
              
   It means that there is a library mismatch problem in the&nbsp;version 
of Adapt It's adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility&nbsp;that it installed on the user's system. On the Adapt 
It website we have posted versions of the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility program for i386 
(32-bit) and amd64 (64-bit) architectures for the Lucid, Maverick, Natty, 
and Oneiric Ubuntu distributions. If you have Internet access, you&nbsp;should also 
be able to resolve this issue, by downloading a version of adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt that is 
appropriate for your computer system and 
ensuring that it is located in the 
correct system directory and has executable permissions. Here are the          
            
             
      steps:</p>
<p>          
            
             
      1. First, ensure that you have upgraded your version of 
Adapt It to at least version 6.1.0 from the packages.sil.org/ubuntu repository. 
Look at the "About Adapt It..." selection on the Help menu to verify your 
installed version of Adapt It is at least 6.1.0.<br><br>          
            
             
                
       
           
             
            
           
            
              
              
              
             
          
           
              
2.&nbsp;Click on one of the following 
links, or enter the appropriate&nbsp;URL into the 
address bar of your browser&nbsp;(depending on your architecture and Ubuntu

      Your browser should then download the 
adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility file. Note the location where your browser 
downloads the file. <br>          
            
             
                
       
           
             
            
           
            
              
              
              
             
          
       Note: If you are 
using&nbsp;Balsa&nbsp;the download of the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt utility will probably go into the Downloads folder on 
advisor@Balsa. That copy of the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt 
utility is built specifically for Ubuntu Lucid 
i386, so it should work on your Lucid based Balsa          
            
             
      installation.</p>
<p>          
            
             
      3.&nbsp;Verify&nbsp;where Adapt It&nbsp;is installed on 
your system. It would normally be installed to either 
the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/bin/</strong> directory or 
the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong> directory:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font 
face=Courier><strong>ls -l /usr/bin/adaptit*</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>ls -l 
/usr/local/bin/adaptit*<br></strong></font><br>Note the location of the adaptit 
it executable file for the copy destination in the next step. In most cases that 
location would be <strong>/usr/bin/</strong>          
            
             
                
       
           
             
            
           
            
              
              
              
             
          
           
              
      
       
                   
            
             
      .</p>
<p>          
            
             
      4. Start a Terminal session and, as super user from the 
command-line,&nbsp;copy the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt file to 
the&nbsp;<strong>/usr/bin</strong> directory (or 
<strong>/usr/local/bin/</strong> if the above step locates it 
there):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>sudo cp 
Downloads/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt /usr/bin<br></strong></font><br>5. Check the 
permissions on the adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt file at the location you copied it to 
in the step above:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier"><strong>ls -l 
/usr/bin/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt</strong></font><br><br>6. If it does not have 
executable permissions (-rwxr-xr-x) on the file, invoke chmod to make&nbsp;the 
adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt file&nbsp;executable:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font 
face=Courier><strong> sudo chmod a+x 
/usr/bin/adaptit-bibledit-rdwrt<br></strong></font><br>You should then be able 
to set up Adapt It 6.1.0 to successfully collaborate with Bibledit. Detailed 
instructions for that setup are found in the Help_for_Administrators.htm file 
located in the installation at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font 
face=Courier><strong>/usr/share/adaptit/help/Help_for_Administrators.htm</strong></font><br><br>That 
Help_for_Administrators.html file&nbsp;can also be loaded into the default 
browser while running Adapt It by selecting the <strong>Help for Administrators 
(HTML)</strong> menu item from Adapt It's <strong>Administrator</strong> 
menu.<br><br>          
            
             
                
If you still find that collaboration with 
Bibledit is failing after trying the above, please inform&nbsp;the Adapt It 
developers about the problem, so we can find a solution and possibly make 
a corrected version available in a future&nbsp;update at packages.sil.org. If you continue 
to&nbsp;get&nbsp;one or more of the above&nbsp;errors or some other error during 
collaboration, please write down the text of any error messages that appear, 
and include that information&nbsp;with any reports problem reports you send us. If you have 
Internet acces you can try submitting a report directly from Adapt It (see the 
"Report a Problem..." selection from Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a report 
via regular email (our email addresses are shown on Adapt It's "About Adapt 
It..." selection on the Help menu. Please include&nbsp;what distribution of 
Ubuntu you&nbsp;are running&nbsp;and whether it is a 32-bit (i386) or 64-bit 
(amd64) system, plus any other details you think might help us to provide a 
fix.&nbsp;Detailed information about your system&nbsp;should be 
available&nbsp;by accessing&nbsp;your System Info (via System &gt;Administration 
&gt; System Monitor, or System Settings &gt; System Info on          
            
             
      Unity).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Adapt It and find it to be a 
useful and effective tool in your work and ministry!</p>
