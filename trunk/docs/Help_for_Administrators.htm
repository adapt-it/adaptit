<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are 
on Adapt It's Administrator menu. This menu is normally hidden from view. It can 
only be shown and accessed under password control. To make the Administrator 
menu visible you can select the <strong>Show Administrator Menu</strong> menu 
item from the View menu. To initially show the Administrator menu you will need 
to use the <a href="#default_password">default password</a>. Once you have 
access to the Administrator menu&nbsp;you can assign a personalized password for 
accessing the Administrator menu, however, the <a 
href="#default_password">default password</a> will always work to make the 
Administrator menu visible at any time.</p>
<p>                  
             
     The Adapt It team highly recommends that you 
take advantage of the Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful 
setup can make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and 
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as <a 
href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> .</p>

<h2><a 
name=Automatically_exchange_Scripture_files></a>Automatically exchange Scripture files with Paratext or 
Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7 or Bibledit, you can now set up 
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a 
href="http://#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a 
href="http://#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>            
        . Here are the 
steps:</p>
<h2><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3>1. Prepare at least two&nbsp;Paratext projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Paratext, you should ensure that Paratext has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong>. These projects should be set up, complete with books either imported or 
created within Paratext BEFORE you set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext. 
Note: The books for the translation drafts and/or free translations should 
exist in the Paratext projects, even though they may be empty of text&nbsp;- 
such "empty" books should have&nbsp;chapter and verse usfm markers present.</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 419px; HEIGHT: 415px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=419 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/PTNewProject.gif" width=400 height=381></p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Paratext "Project Properties and Settings"&nbsp; 
      dialog</p></td></tr></table><br>IMPORTANT: From within Paratext's 
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong> dialog you should ensure that 
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly for each project that Adapt 
It will collaborate with. It is the <strong>Language</strong> setting in the 
above dialog where the Paratext language of the "source" and "target" (and "free 
translation") projects are determined within Paratext. Press the 
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New</strong> button to enter&nbsp;a unique&nbsp;language 
name for each project. Therefore, if the 
Paratext&nbsp;project&nbsp;uses&nbsp;<strong>Swahili</strong> in the "source" 
project's Language 
field, and&nbsp; <strong> English</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;"target texts" 
project,&nbsp;then Adapt It will assume that&nbsp;its own collaboration project 
should be&nbsp;named "<strong>  Swahili&nbsp;to&nbsp;English 
adaptations</strong>". When set up for collaboration, Adapt It will use any Adapt 
It project that&nbsp;already exists by that name, or if an&nbsp;Adapt It project&nbsp;by 
that name does not already exist,&nbsp;it will create a new one by that name in 
its own work folder ("Adapt It Unicode Work" in the Unicode version, or "Adapt 
It Work" in the non-Unicode version).</p>
<h3>2. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width=300 height=240>  </p>
<p align="left">When you selecte "Setup Paratext Collaboration..." the following 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 407px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=389 align=center>
  
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" hspace="0" 
      src="Images/Admin_help/SetupPTCollabWithoutLangNamesCtrls.gif" width=500 
      height=350></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The "Set Up Paratext Collaboration" 
  dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p> <br>You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on 
this dialog:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Before doing any other setup you 
must <strong>verify that the Paratext projects have already been created within 
Paratext</strong>             
     . A minumum of at least two Paratext 
projects are required: One Paratext project for obtaining source texts for 
adaptation work in Adapt It; and a different Paratext project to receive the 
adaptated texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free 
translation in addition to an adaptation, you may want to have a third Paratext 
project set up to receive free translations.</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long 
term goal in mind when creating the Paratext projects and the books for those 
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the Paratext project used for 
source texts&nbsp;ALL books that may eventually be adapted using Adapt It. In 
the Paratext project that is to receive adapted texts, you should 
<strong>create</strong> (or import if they exist) ALL the books that may ever be 
translated now at the beginning of the project. When creating books in the 
Paratext projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they 
should be created empty, but&nbsp;<strong>with chapter and verse 
numbers</strong>             
             
           
             
              
              
    (the Paratext default).</p>
<p>Each line in the list displays a single Paratext project.&nbsp;List lines have up to four parts separated by 
colon characters (:). The first part is the Paratext "Short Name". The second part is 
the Paratext "Full Name" for that project. The third part is the "Language" 
name. The fourth part&nbsp;(if it has been defined within Paratext) is the Ethnologue 
code for that project. Important: If you do not see the 
projects listed that your user will need to use in collaboration, you should STOP at this 
point in the Adapt It setup. Cancel from the Setup Bibledit Collaboration dialog&nbsp;- and do the 
necessary setup of the Paratext projects first. You will not be able to complete 
the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the necessary Paratext projects 
already exist.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> &nbsp;Once you have ensured that 
the necessary Paratext projects have been created, you need to <strong>select at 
least two of those projects using the "Select from List" buttons</strong>           
              
    shown in step 2. Click on the first "Select from 
List" button and select the Paratext project from which source texts will be 
obtained during collaboration. Then click on the second "Select from List" 
button and select&nbsp;a different&nbsp;Paratext project which is to receive 
translation drafts during collaboration. If you have set up a third Paratext 
project to receive free translations, use the third button to select that 
project. The Paratext projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of 
the "Select from List" buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for 
receiving free translations, you can clear that project's selection using the 
"No Free Translation" button.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Adapt It automatically enters any Adapt It project that it knows about 
based on the Language fields specified in the projects selected for obtaining 
source texts and for receiving translation drafts. If Adapt It has been 
used&nbsp;previously for the same languages, it will hook up to the project 
listed in the drop down box during collaboration. If Adapt It has not been used 
previously for the same language pair, it will create a new Adapt It project by 
the name in the drop down box. If no Adapt It project exists that is suitable, 
you may select &lt;Create a new project instead&gt; from the drop down box - in 
which case edit boxes will appear in which you can specify the names to be used 
for the source and target languages that will make up the name of a new Adapt It 
project. When Adapt It works in collaboration with Paratext, it not only 
transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext projects - it also 
maintains its own project in the computer's "Adapt It Unicode Work" 
folder&nbsp;(or Adapt It Work folder for the non-Unicode version).</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Finally, <strong>click on the radio 
button labeled "Collaboration ON"</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong>            
   button. This activates the collaboration&nbsp;between Adapt It 
and&nbsp;Paratext. In a few seconds you should see the&nbsp;following 
main&nbsp;dialog the user will normally see during collaboration:</p>
<p><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width=500 
height=260></p>
<p>From this simple dialog the user can select a Scripture book and chapter for 
collaboration. When OK is clicked, Adapt It will automatically fetch the source 
text and any existing target text from Paratext - merging them if necessary, and 
display them in Adapt It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation 
process. When work is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers 
the saved work back to the appropriate Paratext projects.</p>
<p>               
              
As the dialog shows, the user can select to work either 
by chapter, or by whole book. Working by chapter is the default 
and recommended method of work for collaborating with Paratext. Working by whole book 
is an option and may be desirable for shorter books. Either method is 
OK, but a user should work chapter-by-chapter throughout a whole book, and not 
work by whole book one day and chapter-by-chapter on another day. The method 
of working for a given book should remain consistent throughout a whole book.</p>
<p>               
              
Working chapter-by-chapter in Adapt It used to involve a lot of 
work, manually copying and joining files together into whole books and copying 
them back and forth between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Working 
chapter-by-chapter is now done seamlessly as Adapt It knows how to handle all 
the details and keep everything organized behind the scenes - invisible to the 
user. During collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the 
computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Paratext projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>
<h3>3. Adapt It - Paratext collaboration remains in effect until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Paratext if you want to do so by using the same Setup 
Paratext Collaboration dialog and clicking the&nbsp;Collaboration OFF radio 
button. Any documents created while collaboration&nbsp;was ON are still 
available in the Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt It reverts to using its Start Working 
Wizard for selecting projects and documents by name. Adapt It remembers the 
settings you made while collaboration was on, and if you later 
decide to turn collaboration ON again, all that&nbsp;you need to do is to click 
on the Collaboration ON radio button. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Bibledit_Steps_Start"></a>Bibledit</h2>
<h4>1. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for 
collaboration with Adapt It</h4>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to 
collaborate with Bibledit, you should ensure that Bibledit has at least 
<strong>TWO</strong> projects set up - one project for obtaining 
<strong>source</strong> texts, and a different project to receive the 
<strong>translation drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to 
have a third project set up within Bibledit for storing <strong>Free 
translations</strong> . These projects should be set up, complete with books 
either imported or created within Bibledit <strong>BEFORE</strong>          
             
         you set 
up Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit. Select File &gt; Project &gt; New 
to access Bibledit's "Project properites" dialog. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table style="WIDTH: 412px; HEIGHT: 352px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" 
width=412 align=center>
  
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="center">The Bibledit "Project properties" 
dialog</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p align="left">Note: You can ignore the Language setting 
field shown above during the setup for collaboration. If you know how to set up 
a customized Bibledit language name you can do so, but because of the difficulty 
for most users in setting up a custom language for the above Language drop down 
list, Adapt It will not make use of&nbsp;the "Language" setting here in the 
Bibledit Project's&nbsp;properties 
dialog. Instead Adapt It&nbsp;will ask you in step 2 below for the 
language names it will use&nbsp;for the Bibledit projects participating in&nbsp;the collaboration process.</p>

computer's file system - never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>The "Select a book" list will display all books that have been pre-created in the 
Bibledit projects. The "Select a chapter" list shows each chapter that is 
available for collaboration work. The chapter list also indicates the "Chapter 
status" for each chapter. The text box under the lists also gives more details 
about the status of a selected chapter.</p>
<h3>3. Adapt It - Bibledit collaboration remains in effect until switched off</h3>
<p>The settings you make in the Administrator menu remain 
in effect indefinitely or until such time as you change them. You can switch OFF 
collaboration with Bibledit if you want to do so by using the same Setup 
Bibledit Collaboration dialog and clicking the Collaboration OFF radio button. 
Any documents created while collaboration was ON are still available in the 
Adapt It project that was used during collaboration, but Adapt It reverts to using its Start Working 
Wizard for selecting projects and documents by name. Adapt It remembers the 
settings you made while collaboration was on, and if you later 
decide to turn collaboration ON again, all that you need to do is to 
click on the Collaboration ON radio button.</p>

<h2><a name="Setup_User_Workflow_Profile"></a>    Set up a 
User Workflow Profile</h2>
<p>Adapt It has many menu items and features to choose 
from. Such choices may be bewildering to a new user or inexperienced user. Adapt 
It now allows an administrator to control which choices appear in the program's 
interface, and which others remain hidden until such time as they may be needed. 
To activate a user workflow profile, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the&nbsp;Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select User Workflow Profiles... menu item.&nbsp;The following 
dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/User_workflow_profiles.gif" width=400 height=429>       
  </p>
<p>This dialog organizes Adapt It's menu selections, 
Preferences tabs, Mode bar items, and&nbsp;Tool bar items into four lists or 
"profiles"&nbsp;that correspond&nbsp;to the four tabs at the top of the dialog. 
Those tabs or profiles are labeled "Novice", "Experienced", "Skilled" and 
"Custom." The list in each tab all contain the same list of items, but we've 
preselected certain items on each list that we think should be visible for that 
profile, and un-selected those items that we think would be good to remain 
hidden for the given profile. The Novice profile starts with most of the listed 
items hidden (un-ticked). The Experienced profile makes a few more items visible 
in the interface (by ticking&nbsp;more items). The Skilled profile makes many 
more interface items visible (by ticking even more items).</p>
<p>Our suggestions are only a starting point; each profile 
can be further customized by you, the administrator, to your liking and 
according to your knowledge of the skills and needs of the user. If you select 
the fourth tab labeled "Custom" Adapt It will ask you if you want to initialize 
the selections from one of the other three profiles as a starting point 
-&nbsp;from which you may continue to customize which interface items are to be 
shown (ticked), and which should be hidden (un-ticked).</p>
<p>The default profile&nbsp;setting is 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menus and settings visible)". If you want to 
use a workflow profile, you first need to click the radio button labeled, 
"<strong>Use a workflow profile</strong> (select from drop down list below)". 
This selection enables the drop down box located below it. Only one profile can 
be selected at a given time for the user. You can select the desired profile by 
using the drop down box which will allow you&nbsp;to select the Novice, 
Experienced, Skilled or the Custom profile. Then, to make the interface start 
using a selected profile click on the "Save Changes" button.</p>
<p>At any time you can come back to the User Workflow 
Profiles dialog and switch to a different profile or adjust the individual items 
that should be visible or hidden for a given profile, and save the changes.</p>
<p>If you modified the items in a given profile, and now 
want to revert&nbsp;that profile to its "factory defaults" you can do so by 
first selecting that profile in the drop down box, and then clicking on&nbsp;the 
"Revert to factory defaults" button. If the "Revert to factory defaults" button 
is disabled, it means that you have not changed the viewing status of any 
individual item in that profile's list.</p>
<p>To stop using&nbsp;a user profile, simply click on the 
"<strong>None</strong> (keep all menu and settings visible)" radio button. Adapt 
It will remember your settings in case you later decide to re-activate a 
workflow profile that you set up previously.</p>
<p>The next help topic for Administrators is how to<a 
  href="#Pre-Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">Pre-Assign locations for the 
  various kinds of inputs and outputs</a>.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a 
name=Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs></a>Pre-Assign locations for the various kinds of 
inputs and outputs</h2>
<p>Some computer users find it difficult or confusing to 
navigate through a hierarchical file system. They often are not sure where the 
files are located that they need to open, or where to save or export files from 
Adapt It. They may get lost navigating around the file system inside a file 
browser. They may not really know what a file would be called that they are 
looking for, nor what a file should be called when saving or exporting data from 
Adapt It. Adapt It 6 now allows you the administrator to pre-assign locations 
for any and all the kinds of inputs and outputs that can be done by a user. We 
call this a way to "protect" a user from having to do any navigation of the file system in order to get 
his work done.</p>
<p>Adapt It now allows you the administrator, to pre-assign 
locations for Adapt It's inputs and outputs, and therefor protect the user from 
having to compose file names and from having to navigate the file system to find 
or save files. To activate these protections, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select the "Assign Locations for Inputs and 
Outputs..." menu item.</p>
<p>If you plan to setup Adapt It to collaborate with 
Paratext or Bibledit you should do that setup step before assigning locations 
for inputs and outputs. If you have Paratext (or Bibledit) installed on the 
user's computer and collaboration has not yet been set up, Adapt It will display the following reminder before the 
main dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Reminder_to_setup_PT_first_before_assigning_locations.gif" 
width=400 height=148>       
  </p>
<p>After clicking OK, the main dialog appears, which 
looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_dlg_nothing_ticked.gif" width=500 
height=292>       
  </p>
<p>By default none of the "Protect from Navigation" check 
boxes are ticked. Each of the names in upper case letters and starting 
with&nbsp;one or two&nbsp;initial _ underscore characters, are the names of a 
standard set of folders that Adapt It 6 will automatically create on the user's 
computer. These folder locations will become the default location for the types 
of data described by the folder's names. If you as administrator, wish to 
"protect" that type of data, you can simply put a tick by as many folder 
locations as you want. If you want to protect all the types of data that Adapt 
It uses or exports, simply click on the "Protect All (Check 
All Boxes)" button.</p>
<p>A setup for a fully protected user (with Paratext collaboration turned ON) would 
look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs_all_checked.gif" 
width=500 height=292>       
  </p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It is working in collaboration with 
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically limits the location&nbsp;for 
the&nbsp;source text inputs it obtains for adaptation work, and it also limits 
the locations where translation drafts are exported - to the Paratext or 
Bibledit projects that are assigned during collaboration.&nbsp; Therefore, if 
you have previously set up Adapt It to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, 
the "Protext from Navigation" check boxes to the right of __SOURCE_INPUTS and 
_TARGET_OUTPUTS will indicate that they are "Using Paratext project"; they will be automatically ticked and 
cannot be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a folder location has "Protect from Navigation" 
activated, Adapt It will not ask the user for a file name nor allow the user to 
navigate to a different folder, but will automatically assign a file name to the 
input or output file, and read it from or store it to 
the indicated location.</p>
<p>Whe Adapt It assigns names to files, it composes the 
name based on the type of contents and adds a date-time "stamp" at the end of 
the name, and affixes the appropriate extension. This results in some long file 
names, but that is of no concern to the user, because when "Protect from 
Navigation" is activated the user doesn't have to interact with files or file 
names. For example, the automatically composed name for an RTF export of the target text might look 
something like this:</p><strong>_Target_Text_45_ACT_CH02_exported_2011_07_11T14_25_53Z.rtf</strong>
<p>and it would be located in the 
<strong>_TARGET_RTF_OUTPUTS</strong>    folder of the 
Adapt It project.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the Assign Locations For Inputs 
and Outputs dialog to help keep your user's data organized into predictable 
locations and its files consistently named - so that they are easily identified as to 
content and&nbsp;creation date.</p>
<p>When Adapt It is setup for collaboration with Paratext 
or Bibledit, Adapt It keeps a copy of each chapter or book file that it obtains 
from Paratext/Bibledit - placing the copy in the 
<strong>__SOURCE_INPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project that is hooked 
up to Paratext/Bibledit during collaboration. The files that Adapt It puts in 
the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder are named automatically by Adapt It, and will have a 
_Collab_ prefix on the name.&nbsp;A chapter file for chapter 2 of the book of 
Matthew obtained from Paratex or Bibledit will be named similar to 
the following example:</p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.txt</strong>
<p>If collaboration is done by&nbsp;whole book, a&nbsp;file 
obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to 
the following example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.txt</strong>       
  </p>
<p>The adaptation documents that Adapt It creates - 
regardless of whether collaboration is ON or OFF, are still stored in the 
"<strong>Adaptations</strong>" folder of the Adapt It project. When 
collaboration is turned ON, those files are automatically named by Adapt It. The adaptation document for Matthew chapter 2 
would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.xml</strong>       
  </p>
<p>and the adaptation document for the whole book of Matthew 
would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.xml</strong>       
  </p>
<p>in either case these xml formatted adaptation 
documents&nbsp;are always&nbsp;located in the <strong>Adaptations</strong>    folder of the 
Adapt It project.</p>

<h2><a name="Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders"></a>    Moving or copying 
files or folders.</h2>
<p>As an administrator you may have a need to move or copy 
files from within Adapt It. Adapt It 6 provides an "intelligent" file browser 
for administrative use. To get Adapt It's file browser, <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the Administrator menu 
visible</a>, then select the "Move Or Copy Folders Or Files..." menu item. When you do so the following dual 
pane dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/Move_or_Copy_Folders_or_Files.gif" width=500 
height=311>       
  </p>
<p>Note that generally, if your users are going to be 
working&nbsp;with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, you 
probably do not need to worry about moving or copying files or folders for Adapt 
It's use. In collaboration work the main data you will be concerned about will 
be the data kept in the Paratext or Bibledit data store. In collaboration mode 
Adapt It becomes an adaptation engine for Paratext or Bibledit, and the 
scripture data essentially stays within the Paratext or Bibledit projects. Adapt 
It automatically&nbsp;makes copies of the data and creates its own project for 
the purposes of adaptation, and Adapt It automatically transfers its target 
texts (translation drafts) back to Paratext or Bibledit. Hence, all data is 
destined to start and end within the 
designated Paratext/Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>The above "intelligent" file browser can be helpful if 
you do not plan to work with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or 
Bibledit. In such cases, you can use this dialog to copy potential source texts into an Adapt It 
project's __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.</p>

<h2><a 
name=Setting_up_an_administrator_password></a>     Setting up 
an administrator password</h2>
<p>To access the Administrator menu you first need to make 
the Administrator menu visible. From within Adapt It click on the "Show 
Administrator Menu..." item on the View menu. For the password, you can always 
enter the <a name="default_password"></a>default password which is the word admin. 
You can also set your own password using the Administrator menu item for that 
purpose. The administrator password is not a highly guarded secret, but exists 
only to hinder inexperienced users from accessing the administrator menu and 
changing settings they should not be changing. If you set your own password it 
will be kept unencrypted in the basic configuration file 
AI-BasicConfiguration.aic located in the Adapt It Unicode Work folder (or Adapt 
It Work folder for the non-Unicode application). If you forget your password, 
you can find it in the AI-BasicConfiguration.aic file, or you can simply use the default 
password mentioned above.</p>

<h2><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special considerations for using Adapt It under the 
Balsa system</h2>
<p>           
             
               
        What version of Balsa are you 
using? If you are using Balsa based on any distribution after Lucid, you should 
already have Adapt It version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see 
if there are any recent updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x at the&nbsp;packages.sil.org repository. 
When the Lucid version of Balsa boots up, and you log on to the Balsa User 
account, the opening screen looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/BalsaOpeningScreen.gif" width=500 height=293>           
             
               
              
              
              
              
                
      </p>
<p>           
             
               
              
         The Lucid version of Balsa 
as shown above has Adapt It version 5.2.4. You will need Adapt It version 
6.x.x in order to take advantage of its new features designed for assisting translation 
program administrators, and especially working in collaboration with the Balsa Scripture editor Bibledit. The icon for 
Adapt It version 6 looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" 
src="Images/Admin_help/ai_new_icon.gif" width=107 height=118>           
             
               
              
              
              
              
                
      </p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: 
<strong>Advisor</strong> and <strong>Balsa User</strong>. You as an 
administrator need to log in first as Advisor to update Adapt It to its latest 
version 6 update which has many new features designed to assist you as an 
administrator. Then, once you have upgraded Adapt It to version 6, you should 
<strong>log off as Advisor</strong> and <strong>log back in as the</strong> 
<strong>Balsa User</strong>          
               
               
       to complete the setup of Adapt It 
for that given user. Except for upgrading Adapt It to the latest version 6.x.x, all remaining setup 
of Adapt It should be done using the Balsa User account. The steps for doing these 
things are listed below:</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading Adapt It 
to version 6 (if needed)</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Advisor</strong>     account in the Balsa 
system.<br>2. Run the <strong>Synaptic Package 
Manager</strong> by selecting it from the Applications &gt; System menu. In the 
Quick search box type the word adaptit. The "Installed" version of adaptit 
listed there should be at least 6.0.0. If the package manager doesn't indicate 
that version 6.x.x is already installed, you should go ahead and mark it for 
installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card form of Balsa, you probably will 
want to also mark adaptit-docs for installation (although please note 
that&nbsp;the adaptit-docs package&nbsp;is about 11MB of download). <br>3. After 
you have ensured that Adapt It version 6.x.x is installed, you can close the 
package manager and <strong>log off the Advisor Balsa account</strong>           
             
              
           
                
             
              
             . 
Next you will need to log on to the Balsa User account (see below).</p>
<h3>Logging on to the Balsa User account and configuring 
Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Balsa User</strong>      account.<br>2. On the "Work" desktop double click on the <strong>Adapt 
It icon</strong> to start up Adapt It.<br>3. Set up the necessary Bibledit 
projects for collaboration. You will need at least two Bibledit projects: One 
for obtaining source texts, and one for receiving translation (target text) 
drafts.<br>4. Access Adapt It's <strong>Administrator menu</strong> (see how to 
access the Administrator menu <a 
href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">here</a>).<br>5. After creating the 
Bibledit projects (step 3), set up Adapt it to collaborate with Bibledit (follow 
the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> section of this document for 
detailed steps).<br>6. Assign locations for inputs and outputs using the dialog 
for that purpose. It is recommended that you tick all of the "Protect from 
Navigation" check boxes. See <a 
href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">this section</a>&nbsp;for 
details.</p>
