<title>Using RFC5646 Private Use Subtags</title>

<h2 align="center">Using RFC5646 Private Use Subtags</h2>
<p>The 2-letter or 3-letter codes available from the <strong>Lookup Iso639 Codes...</strong> button come from the ISO639-1 and ISO639-3 standards.</p>
<p>The 3-letter codes come from the SIL Ethnologue. Sometimes those short codes are not enough.</p>
<p>The Ethnologue often has no codes for <strong>dialects</strong> of a language, which is a problem when sharing knowledge bases for adaptations done between dialects of a language.</p>
<p>Handling this situation requires codes from the <strong>RFC5646 standard</strong>, and in particular, using the <strong>Private Use Subtags</strong> part of the standard.</p><br>
<p>The private use subtags can be defined by you. The ISO639 2-letter or 3-letter code comes first, then -x- and after that the private use tag.</p>
<p>The private use tag may only be letters or numbers or both, and must not exceed 8 characters in length.</p>
<p>For example: the Barai (PNG) language ISO369-3 code is <strong>bbb</strong>. Bariai has two dialects, <strong>Birarie</strong>, and <strong>Muguani</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are two suitable RFC5654 codes which comply with the standard:  <strong>bbb-x-birarie</strong>  and  <strong>bbb-x-muguani</strong>.</p>
<p>It is good practice to just use lower case letters. Avoid using short tags, because private use tags should be unique.</p><br>
<p>Defining language codes should be done by someone with linguistics training.</p>
<p>If necessary, define your own RFC5654 codes following the above guidelines, and then type the extra code letters into the text boxes of the <strong>Create Definitions for Shared Knowledge Bases</strong> page, where needed.</p>
<p>If you do that, you must inform your co-workers about the codes which are to be used, because knowledge base sharing relies on each person in the one translation project using exactly the same codes.</p>
