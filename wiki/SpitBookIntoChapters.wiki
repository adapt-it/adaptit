= Introduction =

Adapt It offers an easy way to create a series of single chapter adaptation documents from a book document. This procedure assumes that you are in Book Folder mode (See OpenBookFolderMode) and that you want to break _Luke_ into single chapter documents. This procedure also assumes that the source document contains properly formatted Standard Format Markers.

  # Open the project and the document to be split into chapter sized documents.
  # In the _Tools_ menu, select the _Split Document…_ option.
  # Select the _Luke_ document. (It should already be identified.)
  # Select the *Split into single chapter documents* option.
  # Type *Luke* or another appropriate name into the text box.
  # Click *Split Now*
Adapt It creates 24 new documents named _Luke01.xml, Luke02.xml, … Luke24.xml_.
  # Adapt It tells you that it has completed spitting the documents. Click *OK*.
  # Click *Close* to close the _Split The Open Document Into Smaller Documents_ dialog.
  # Adapt It opens the Document dialog listing all of the new documents. Select the desired chapter document and click *Finish*
Adapt It opens the desired chapter ready for adaptation.
