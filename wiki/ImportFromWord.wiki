#summary Importing source file prepared in Word in the wrong format leads to corrupted source text in Adapt It documents.

=Introduction=

If your source text file has been prepared in Microsoft word, and you do not save the file as a text file (txt), the result in Adapt It will appear as garbage symbols.

Adapt It cannot use the standard Word formats such as doc or rtf as input. 

=Procedure=

 # Open the Word Document that you want to import.
 # From the File Menu select Save As…
 # Type the desired file name into the text box at the bottom.  
 # Type in the file name you want to use
 # Select the file type of txt from the combo box labeled “Save as type:.” Click on the down arrow to display the list of options, scroll down and select the item "Plain Text (.txt)"
 # Click Save.
 # You should see a dialog called "File Conversion - <your document's name>"
   * If you are using Western fonts, continue to the next step.     
   * If you are using non-Western fonts, click the "Other encoding" button. The list at the top right becomes enabled.    
   * Scroll until you see an entry called "Unicode" (There are several entries that include the word Unicode; choose the one that just says Unicode.) 
 # Click OK to save the file.
