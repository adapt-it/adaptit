/// \description This is the header file for the CAdapt_ItApp class, the AIModalDialog
/// class and the AutoCorrectTextCtrl class.
/// The CAdapt_ItApp class initializes Adapt It's application and gets it running. Most of
/// Adapt It's global enums, structs and variables are declared either as members of the
/// CAdapt_ItApp class or in this source file's global space. The AIModalDialog class
/// provides Adapt It with a modal dialog base class which turns off Idle and UIUpdate
/// processing while the dialog is being shown. The AutoCorrectTextCtrl class defines
/// a wxTextCtrl class that implements the AutoCorrect functions.
/// \derivation	The CAdapt_ItApp class is derived from wxApp, and inherits its support
/// for the document/view framework. The AIModalDialog class is derived from 
/// wxScrollingDialog when built with wxWidgets prior to version 2.9.x, but derived 
/// from wxDialog for version 2.9.x and later. The AutoCorrectTextCtrl class derives 
/// from wxTextCtrl.

//#define TRACK_PHRBOX_CHOOSETRANS_BOOL

// Use the following #define, in _DEBUG mode, to turn on the use of a logging function called
// LogDropdownState() which uses a set of wxLogDebug() calls internally to track the values of
// parameters like m_TargetBox::m_bAbandonable flag, the box's contents, and app's 
// string contents for the member m_targetPhrase, pActiveSrcPhrase's m_key and m_adaption and
// m_nSequNumber; and from the KB, the pTU's inventory of CRefString instances'm_translation 
// string values and the value of each's m_bDeleted  boolflag. And to print the callers name and
// line number for where LogDropdownState() is being called. Callable only in _DEBUG builds.

// BEW 16Feb22 it's time to suppress a number of wxLogDebug calls used when fixing the GUI layout for version 6.10.5
//#define GUIFIX

// whm added 5Jun12 for debugging purposes. The FORCE_BIBLEDIT_IS_INSTALLED_FLAG
// is set at the beginning of Adapt_It.h. When set it does the following:
// 1. Forces the this BibleditIsInstalled() function to return TRUE
// 2. Forces the App's m_bBibleditIsInstalled member to be TRUE
// 3. Forces the GetListOfBEProjects() function to return an array of three
//    dummy Bibledit project names: Nyindrou, Tok Pisin, and Free Trans. See the
//    GetListOfBEProjects() function.
// 4. Forces the CollabProjectIsEditable() function (in CollabUtilities.cpp) to
//    return TRUE.
// 5. Forces the CollabProjectHasAtLeastOneBook() function (in CollabUtilities.cpp)
//    to return TRUE.

// whm 16Sep2021 modifications of application version numbers and dates for consolidation
// and simplification.
// The defines for version number are now consolidated in the _AIandGitVersionNumbers.h 
// header file which is #include'd below.
// 
// Note: the FileVersion and ProductVersion strings in the Adapt_It.rc file in bin/win32 
// now are updated automatically from the defines in the _AIandGitVersionNumbers.h header 
// file. 
// Warning: There is now no need to edit the Adapt_It.rc file to update new version numbers
// or dates.
// The application version numbers and dates are now mainly set in the
// _AIandGitVersionNumbers.h header file (included below). However, the version numbers 
// and/or date numbers for the following still need to be set manually in these locations:
// 1. The applicationCompatibility attribute's version number  in the AI_UserProfiles.xml 
// file in the adaptit/xml folder. Just update the version number.
// 2. The Visual Studio 2019 Adapt_It > Properties > Linker > General > Version (do for 
//    both the Unicode Debug and Unicode Release Configurations).
//    The Version in the Linker settings, just uses the first two version digits - the
//    MAJOR and MINOR numbers, i.e., 6.10 which keeps things compatible with newer 
//    versions of Visual Studio.
// 3. The Mac's Info.plist file in adaptit/bin/mac/ (Erik B. does Mac builds for the 
//    Adapt_It-x.x.x.dmg distribution). Change in two locations within the Info.plist file
// 4. The changelog file at: adaptit/debian/changelog. Add a new entry at top of file for
//    new version and release date.
// 5. Various documentation files in the adaptit/docs folder files including: 
//    [ ] Adapt It changes.txt
//    [ ] Readme_Unicode_Version.txt
//    [ ] Known Issues and Limitations.txt
//    [ ] Adapt It Reference.odt (also Save As Adapt It Reference.doc)
// 6. Within the AboutDlgFunc() in wxDesigner change the version number for the
//    ID_ABOUT_VERSION_NUM wxStaticText to the current version number. Also
//    update the release date there.
//    TODO:
//    Find out why for the Mac build this wxStaticText value is not getting
//    updated from the code in MainFrm.cpp to use the current version number
//    which includes the build number.
// 7. Within the adaptit.1 man page file, change the release date and version number
//    within the .TH line.

// whm 29Jun2021 added the following defines for the current version of Git
// The following three defines are the only three lines that need updating within Adapt It's
// source files. The App's GetVersionNumberAsString() function converts the individual version
// number integers into a formatted string, for example 2.32.0 and the source file named
// InstallGitOptionsDlg.cpp builds the git installer and our git downloader file names from
// these defines. The current git installer from github is:
//   Git-2.32.0-32-bit.exe - which is downloadable from:
//   https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.32.0.windows.1/Git-2.32.0-32-bit.exe
// Our git downloader that is created by Inno Setup is named:
// Git_Downloader_2_32_0_4AI.exe - generated by our Adapt It Unicode Git.iss Inno Setup script.
// When revising code to download a newer version of the git installer from github, and

// 
// whm 24Feb2022 updated. The following #include and callling the wxDISABLE_ASSERTS_IN_RELEASE_BUILD
// macro never worked to disable/prevent asserts in release builds.
// According to this post on the wxWidgets Discussion Forum at: https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?t=34137
// the proper way to disable/prevent asserts in release builds is to do the following:
// 1. Tweak the wxWidgets-3.1.5\include\wx\setup.h file's lines starting about line 90 to 
// check if NDEBUG is defined, and if so to #define wxDEBUG_LEVEL 0.
// that is change the lines in setup.h to the following:
/*
#ifdef NDEBUG
#define wxDEBUG_LEVEL 0
// #else
//  #define wxDEBUG_LEVEL 2
#endif
*/
// 2. After tweaking setup.h you must rebuild the wxWidgets library that is being used.
// 3. In Visual Studio's Adapt_It project properties for Unicode Release > C/C++ > Preprocessor flags add NDEBUG to the list.
//    Only add NDEBUG to the Unicode Release's preprocessor flags, don't add it to the Unicode Debug flags!
// With the above settings, Adapt It's release version should no longer produce asserts in Unicode Release builds.

    // is accepted, the retranslation is lost automatically and if wanted, would have to be
    // manually reconstituted.)

    // Note 2: after a source text edit, the user will be given opportunity to adapt the
    // new material - when he does this, he will be free to create mergers; hence, some of
    // the indices and the count of the number of CSourcePhrase instances in the editable
    // span after editing was completed, which are defined below, will need to be
    // programmatically decreased accordingly. Additional structs will be used for such
    // lower level entry points to the editing process, so that the user can roll back the
    // total vertical editing process at any stage before it ends. Once it ends, the memory
    // of what was done is deleted and the only rollback strategy is manual editing, or to
    // do a new source text edit at the original location.

    // Note 3: our design for the spans involves 2 spans with associated CObLists
    // containing deep copies of CSourcePhrase instances from m_pSourcePhrases list in the
    // document class: the "cancel span" to be used in restoring the original document (see
    // further comments below) if the user Cancels later on, and a modifications span
    // (coextensive with the cancel span) in which modifications are made to the deep
    // copies of the CSourcePhrase instances, readying them for the user's OK button click.
    // There are also three additional overlapping subspans, defined by starting and ending
    // index pairs using sequence number values, but these subspans do not have separate
    // CObLists associated with them, rather, they are defined on both the cancel span and
    // the modifications span, as those spans are coextensive.

    // The first (and minimal length) subspan is the editable span. This is the user's
    // selection, but if the selection overlaps one or more retranslations, the span is
    // widened to include the retranslation/s in its/their entirety.
    // The second subspan is the "free translations span" - it is a span of CSourcePhrase
    // instances where free translation removals need to be done.
    // The third subspan is the "collected back translations span" - it is a span of
    // CSourcePhrase instances where stored back translations have their scope overlapping
    // the information in the editable span (remembering that the editable span may be
    // exended programmatically wider than the user's selection due to the presence of one
    // or more retranslations in the user's selection, or overlapping the user's
    // selection.)
    // These subspans overlap, and involve an inclusion hierarchy: the editable span is
    // equal to or included in the free translation span which is equal to or included in
    // the (collected) back translations span.
    //
    // The modifications span is coextensive with the cancel span and contains deep copies
    // of the CSourcePhrase instances (with sequence numbering preserved). The
    // modifications are to make ready for the CSourcePhrase instances to be inserted in
    // the document's m_pSourcePhrases list once the user dismisses the edit source text
    // dialog with an OK button click. These placements involve replacement of the
    // instances in the editable subspan with CSourcePhrase instances created anew from the
    // edited source text (there may be zero, if the user edits out the whole of the
    // contents of the editable source text string seen in the dialog); but for any
    // extended regions preceding and following the editable span up to the bounds of the
    // cancel span, replacements of the CSourcePhrase instances are done in those regions
    // after the OK button click using the modified CSourcePhrase instances from the
    // modifications span. (The modifications involve the removal of notes, free
    // translations and collected back translations in the appropriate subspans,so that the
    // user does not have to look at their distracting (and possibly copious) information
    // while editing the editable span.) (The cancel span is maintained in case the user
    // Cancels out of the whole vertical editing process, it is not needed for cancelling
    // from the Edit Source Text dialog because when the user presses the Cancel button
    // there, no changes have been made to the original document up to that point.)

    // Note 4: \bt information might be found to have been stored in the editable subspan,
    // and more than one instance could be stored there; the final one of any such could
    // have a "span" (over which collection originally happened) which extends beyond the
    // editable subspan, and may even extend beyond the end of the free translations
    // subspan too - as far as it takes to get to the next location defined by
    // HaltCurrentCollection(). The nBackTrans_EndingSequNum member tracks the
    // CSourcePhrase instance immediately preceding this halt location.

    // Note 5: Because endmarkers are stored on the CSourcePhrase instance immediately
    // following the span of information to which they logically belong, it is possible for
    // the editable span's bounding CSourcePhrase instances to have (a) endmarkers at the
    // start which belong to the preceding context, and / or (b) endmarkers immediately
    // following the end of the editable span which logically belong within it. So we
    // maintain two CString members to store any such endmarker sequences from either or
    // both locations, so that the user can be shown the most logically meaningful editable
    // text string, and to enable replacement of either or both endmarker strings after the
    // edit is done - if that is an appropriate editing operation for the user to do.

	// For docVersion = 5, we no longer store endmarkers at the beggining of a following
	// srcPhrase's m_markers member, but on the relevant one which ends the information
	// type, on its new m_endMarkers member. This makes the comment for Note 5 above
	// obsolete. At the start of the editable span, if the previous CSourcePhrase instance
	// ends a information type with an endmarker, that endmarker is stored in the
	// preceding context in that CSourcePhrase instance's m_endMarkers member. Also, if
	// the editable span ends with endmarkers, they are now stored on the last
	// CSourcePhrase instance of the editable span, again in its m_endMarkers member. So
	// we don't have to make any adjustments for endmarker transfers any longer.

    // Note 6: We also maintain an integer array to store the sequence numbers for the
    // storage locations of any Adapt It Notes which lie within the editable subspan. These
    // location values will be used (and possibly changed, depending on what the user does
    // in his editing - he may remove all source text where they originally were located)
    // in order to programmatically determine suitable locations for rebuilding the notes
    // programmatically once the edit is done. Notes content is not changed - if changes

	// when a user wants to grant someone other than kbadmin to have "All Permissions" needs to be settable
	// programmatically (from Manager, or from GUI menu choice for adding a new user), and it needs to be
	// seen as dots ( a wxDesigner option) in the Change Username dialog, where m_strUserID and m_strFullname
	// are changable manually or programmatically.
	// This calls for an additional member wxString:  m_strPassword, which can be seen as dots in Change Username,
	// and stored in the app in m_strPassword, and can be resettable differently by the user if he or she suspects
	// that the stored pwd is not the one associated with the seen m_strUserID and m_strFullname values. Then I can

	// m_pKB and m_pGlossingKB, so that they are created and destroyed when the adapting
	// CKB instances are created and destroyed, respectively, is deliberate. There are
	// times when local KBs are instantiated for processes that are best handled without
	// an active connection to a remote KBserver database - for instance, transferring
	// adaptations to glosses in a new project; KB restoration via the File > Restore
	// Knowledge Base command; reconstituting a CKB from a git repository, and maybe
	// others. So we'll instantiate KbServer instances only when appropriate.

	// m_pKbServer is an array of two pointers to KbServer instances. Each is NULL
	// everywhere except in a project designated for KB sharing, and that project is
	// currently active (creation and destruction are handled within SetupForKBServer()
	// and ReleaseKBServer(), respectively) See KbServer.cpp, and KbServer.h. The first
	// is for an adapting KB, the second for a glossing KB.

			// would be deleted when the KB Sharing Manager gets deleted. So
			// we don't want either the Manager class, or the
			// KBSharingAuthenticationDlg class owning this pointer.
			// (It needs to persist when a deletion of the entries in a remote
			// kb is being done - deleting is done one by one, so it may take
			// anything from minutes to hours or over a day - depending on
			// how many hundreds, or thousands of entries are to be deleted.
			// A KBserver on the LAN, deletes about 20 a second. One on the
			// web with a high latency (4 secs per entry deleted) can tie up
			// a machine for over a day!!
			// I think the way to handle the problem is to create the instance
			// in the correct active project (because a KbServer instance has a
			// pointer to local CKB instance - but deletion doesn't use the
			// local CKB, so we should be able to safely set that ptr to NULL)
			// and then once the queue is populated with the entries to delete,

	// BEW 2Nov22 Gerald Harkins has a footnote stretch in his document, where \f is followed by \fv
	// without anything but a space between the \f and \fv. For AI, the lack of something that is
	// visible (often people put '+' there) is a severe parsing-error producer. One pSrcPhrase
	// gets its m_markers member set to "\f \fv". I made a change in TokenizeText which forced
	// a new pSrcPhrase to be created when \fv was detected without anything visible as a m_key on
	// the previous pSrcPhrase where the \f is stored. This however, was not a complete solution.
	// m_markers still have the bad sequence "\f \fv" and if the footnote was filtered, the 
	// unacceptible result was that f content was fine, but \fv was treated as for filtering,
	// and all the text content up to the next major marker, or to doc end if there was no marker
	// to halt things, got added as bogus filtered text to the \fv marker. ViewFilteredMaterial dlg
	// then lists both markers, and the stuff which should be scripture text, is in \fv - thereby
	// removing non-footnote scripture content wrongly from the GUI layout.
	// The only reasonable solution, I think, is that if there is no visible content following
	// the \f marker, we have to provide something that can be a visible m_key and m_srcPhrase
	// when parsing in the doc text. There is a Unicode character, '...' which is U+2026
	// "Horizontal Ellipsis" which would fit the bill. We do have placeholders, which are a string
	// of three periods, so that provides some familiarity for the user. But U+2026  is more
	// horizontally squeezed, so a nice option.
	// I'm here going to provide a new puublic member character for the CAdapt_ItApp class, called

#if defined(SCROLLPOS) && defined(__WXGTK__)
    // BEW added 10Dec12
    //This workaround is needed to avoid wxWidgets input focus mechanism from later resetting
    // the focus to the canvas (ie. wxScrolledWindow's subclass) from within wxWidgets
    // windows.cpp's gtk_window_focus_in_callback() function, at the point in that function
    // where its code thinks our canvas window doesn't have focus and so calls the
    // DoSendFocusEvents() on the canvas. That in turn leads to scrlwing.cpp's function
    // HandleOnChildFocus() being called which internally calls its own Scroll(x_Pos, y_Pos)
    // function on the canvas - but with the y_Pos value as stored from before our
    // ScrollIntoView() function gets called - with the final effect of all this being to
    // restore the scroll car to whatever was it's position prior to ScrollIntoView() being
    // called -- and then a repaint event causes the view to be drawn at the old location
    // in the document rather than at the strip where our ScollIntoView() code worked out it
    // should be at.
    // I tried a workaround - to call SetFocus()
    // on the canvas explicitly, so as to avoid wxWidgets having to do it with a wrong y_Pos        // the canvas window the input focus explicitly here, the the DoSendFocusEvents()
    // value; but I couldn't find a place to make that work: tried at the start of
    // ScrollIntoView(), at the end of ScrollIntoView() and also at the end of canvas's
    // OnPaint() call (after it's pView->Draw() call); but the scrollPos value still got
    // clobbered every time, being reset to its old position.
    // Therefore, I conclude the problem is an architectural design flaw in wxWidgets
    // implementation of the interaction between the input focus mechanism anhd scrolling
    // support. The only thing we can do is therefore program a way around the problem, by
    // forcing a further resetting of scrollPos back to where it should be, then repainting
    // the canvas. To ensure the repositioning of the scroll car is done after wxWidgets
    // has done its worst to mess it up for us, I post the needed custom event from an OnIdle()
    // call; and use a boolean m_bAdjustScrollPos defined in the CAdapt_ItApp class to
    // indicate, by setting it TRUE, when this extra adjustment should be done.
    // So far I've identified 3 features that need this support (but only in the __WxXGTK__
    // build): (1) When opening a document in which the initial location of the phrase box
    // is below the bottom of the client window. (2) When requesting a GoTo... some other
    // part of the document beyond the bounds of the currently visible part of the document.
    // (3) When hitting the Cancel And Jump Here button in the View Translation or Glosses
    // Elsewhere In The Document dialog. (Windows and OS X builds work correctly without
    // this kludge.)
