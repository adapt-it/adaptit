# Introduction #

Yes it is easy to do. There is a command which allows you to "merge" (by appending to the end of what proceeds) one or more documents to the end of the currently open document. The steps depend a little on whether you just have two documents in the project, Mak 1-10, and Mak 11-15; or those plus many more from adapting work on other New Testament books. I'll assume you have more than two, and give the steps for that situation.


# Details #

1. Run Adapt It, and get Mak 1-10 open in the main window. The next steps will allow you to join the Mak 11-15 document to the end of the Mak 1-10 document, and rename the resulting file to a suitable name, such as Mak.
2. Do Tools / Join Documents...   and you will see a window called "Join Documents By Appending To The Open Document".
3. If you only have two documents in your project, the dialog's left hand list will just show you the name of the Mak 11-15 document - if you see only Mak-15 in the list, skip to step 4. But if you have other documents already adapted, all of them will be listed. You need to remove from the left list any documents you don't want joined to the end of Mak 1-10. There are some buttons in the top middle of the dialog to help you do that. Here are the steps...
3 (a) Click the button "Move All Right >>"
3 (b) In the right hand list, click the document "Mak 11-15" to select it.
3 (c) Click the button with the large green tick -- that will move the selected document back to the left hand list
4. At the bottom of the dialog is a box where you can type whatever name you want used for the final document. Perhaps Mak, or Mak 1-15, or whatever you want to name it - but do it now before you do step 5.
(If you type nothing, the join at step 5 will still happen, but the data from the two documents will be in Mak 1-10, and Mak 11-15 will no longer exist. If that happens, you can use Windows Explorer to rename the document later on, after you close Adapt It.)
5. Click the Join Now button. The join will be done, and if successful, a message will tell you. Mak 11-15 will no longer exist as a separate document. It's contents will now exist within the joined document.

(For your information: the Join can be done at any time, whether or not you have done any adapting work in the Mak 11-15 document. There is also a Split Document... command, which allows you to split a document into two, or into several using chapter breaks. They can be re-joined later, using the Join Document command.)
